## Office hours

As a professor, I am committed to providing students with the highest quality of education and support. To this end, I will be offering weekly office hours every Thursday from 2-4 pm or by [appointment via Zoom](https://calendly.com/drfurtado). Additionally, I am readily available to answer questions and provide guidance via email.

A lot of questions are most effectively answered in-person, so office hours are a valuable resource. I encourage each and every one of you to take advantage of this resource! Make a pledge to stop by office hours at least once during the first three weeks of class.
