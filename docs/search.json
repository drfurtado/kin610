Before fitting the model, let’s look at the relationship between the two variables. Create a scatterplot to display the relationship between cost and admissions rate.

Click the checkbox next to each file in the Git pane to stage the updates you’ve made, write an informative commit message, and push. After you push the changes, the Git pane in RStudio should be empty.\n\n\n\nExercise 10\nFinally, we want to answer the question “Do the data provide sufficient evidence of a linear relationship between cost and admissions rate, i.e. \\(\\beta_1\\) is different from 0?”\nTo answer this question we will use a hypothesis test. We can conduct a hypothesis test via simulation (what we’ll do in this lab) or using mathematical models (what we’ll do in the next class).\nBefore we can conduct the hypothesis test, let’s first set our hypotheses. Remember that the null hypothesis represents the status quo (nothing going on, i.e. there is no relationship) and the alternative hypothesis represents our research question (there is something going on, i.e. there is a relationship).\n\n\\(H_0\\): There is no linear relationship between the admissions rate and cost of colleges in the United States, \\(\\beta_1 = 0\\)\n\\(H_A\\): There is a linear relationship between the admissions rate and cost of colleges in the United States, \\(\\beta_1 \\ne 0\\)\n\nTo test these hypotheses, we will use a permutation test, where we\n\nSimulate new samples from the original sample via permutation under the assumption that the null hypothesis is true\nFit models to each of the samples and estimate the slope\nUse features of the distribution of the permuted slopes to calculate the p-value for the hypothesis test\n\nThe major difference between constructing a confidence interval and conducting a hypothesis test is that for the hypothesis test we assume that the null hypothesis is true. This requires a simulation scheme that will allow us to measure the natural variability in the data due to sampling but not due to cost and admission rate being correlated by permuting permute one variable to eliminate any existing relationship between the variables. To do so, we randomly assign each admrate value to cost of a given university, i.e. cost and admrate are no longer matched for a given university.\nIn the following code chunk we\n\nFirst set a seed for simulating reproducibly.\nThen, we start with our data frame and specify our model as cost vs. admrate.\nThen, we set our null hypothesis (cost and admrate are independent)\nAnd then we generate 1000 replicates of our data where, for each replicate, we permute values of admrate to randomly assign them to values of cost\nFinally, we fit our model to each of our 1000 permuted datasets\n\n\nset.seed(1234)\n\nperm_fits <- scorecard %>%\n  specify(cost ~ admrate) %>%\n  hypothesize(null = \"independence\") %>%\n  generate(reps = 1000, type = \"permute\") %>%\n  fit()\n\nThe resulting dataset perm_fits has nrow(perm_fits) and ncol(perm_fits) columns. The first column, replicate indicates the replicate number of the dataset the models were fit to; the values in this column range between 1 and 1000. The second column, term, tells us which term (intercept of the model or slope of admrate) the estimate value in the third column is for.\n\nperm_fits\n\n# A tibble: 2,000 × 3\n# Groups:   replicate [1,000]\n   replicate term      estimate\n       <int> <chr>        <dbl>\n 1         1 intercept  36857. \n 2         1 admrate     -781. \n 3         2 intercept  35901. \n 4         2 admrate      643. \n 5         3 intercept  36608. \n 6         3 admrate     -411. \n 7         4 intercept  35831. \n 8         4 admrate      746. \n 9         5 intercept  36367. \n10         5 admrate      -51.7\n# … with 1,990 more rows\n\n\n\nCreate a histogram of the slope estimates in perm_fits. (Hint: Filter the dataset for just the slope values, term == \"admrate\".)\nEstimate the p-value of the hypothesis test based on this distribution.\nState your conclusion for the test in context.\nIndicate whether or not it is consistent with the results of the hypothesis test from the previous exercise. Briefly explain your response.\n\n\nThis is a good place to render, commit, and push changes to your remote lab repo on GitHub.

In this chapter, we will discuss the assumptions, calculations, and interpretation of one-way ANOVA, as well as its strengths and limitations.\nAssumptions\nThere are several assumptions that must be met in order to use one-way ANOVA:\n\nNormality: The data should be approximately normally distributed within each group.\nIndependence: The observations should be independent of each other, meaning that the value of one observation should not affect the value of another observation.\nEqual variance: The variance within each group should be approximately equal.\n\nIf these assumptions are not met, the results of the ANOVA may be biased or unreliable. It is important to check for these assumptions before conducting the test.\nCalculations\nTo calculate a one-way ANOVA, we first need to calculate the sum of squares within groups (SSW) and the sum of squares between groups (SSB). The SSW represents the variance within each group, while the SSB represents the variance between the groups.\nThe formula for calculating the SSW is:\nSSW = Σ(x - x̄)^2\nWhere x is the value of each observation and x̄ is the mean of the group.\nThe formula for calculating the SSB is:\nSSB = k * Σ(x̄ - x̄̄)^2\nWhere k is the number of groups, x̄ is the mean of each group, and x̄̄ is the overall mean of all the groups.\nOnce we have calculated the SSW and SSB, we can then use them to calculate the F statistic, which is used to determine whether there are significant differences between the groups. The F statistic is calculated as follows:\nF = SSB / SSW\nThe F statistic follows an F distribution, which allows us to determine the probability (p-value) that the differences between the groups are due to chance. If the p-value is less than a predetermined level of significance (usually 0.05), we can reject the null hypothesis and conclude that there are significant differences between the groups.\nInterpretation\nIf the p-value is significant, we can conclude that there are differences between the groups. However, we cannot determine which groups are significantly different from each other without conducting additional tests. To determine which groups are significantly different, we can use a post-hoc test, such as the Tukey HSD test or the Bonferroni correction.\nStrengths and Limitations\nOne-way ANOVA is a powerful statistical tool that can be used to compare the means of three or more groups. However, it has some limitations. For example, it is only appropriate for continuous data and cannot be used with categorical data. It also assumes that the variance is equal within each group, which may not always be the case. Additionally, it does not provide information about the direction or size of the differences between the groups.\nConclusion\nOne-way ANOVA is a statistical test used to compare the means of three or more groups. It is a useful tool for understanding the relationships between variables and can be used to test hypotheses about the differences between groups. However, it has some limitations and should be used with caution.\nversion 2\nOne-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) is a statistical test used to compare the means of two or more groups. It is a powerful tool for comparing the means of multiple groups to determine if there are significant differences between them. In this chapter, we will cover the basics of one-way ANOVA and how it can be used in biostatistics.\nTo begin, let’s define some key terms:\n\nThe dependent variable is the variable being measured or observed in an experiment. In the context of one-way ANOVA, the dependent variable is usually continuous (e.g., height, weight, blood pressure).\nThe independent variable is the variable being manipulated or controlled in an experiment. In one-way ANOVA, the independent variable has only one level, meaning that there is only one group being compared.\nThe null hypothesis is the assumption that there is no difference between the means of the groups being compared.\nThe alternative hypothesis is the opposite of the null hypothesis, and states that there is a difference between the means of the groups being compared.\n\nTo conduct a one-way ANOVA, we first need to ensure that our data meets the assumptions of the test. These assumptions include:\n\nNormality: The data must be approximately normally distributed within each group.\nIndependence: The observations within each group must be independent of each other.\nEqual variance: The variances of the groups being compared must be equal.\n\nIf these assumptions are not met, it may be necessary to transform the data or use a different statistical test.\nTo perform a one-way ANOVA, we first calculate the overall mean of the dependent variable. Then, we calculate the mean of the dependent variable for each group and subtract the overall mean from each group mean to obtain the group mean differences. We then divide the sum of the squares of these group mean differences by the number of groups minus one to obtain the between-groups sum of squares.\nNext, we calculate the sum of squares within each group by subtracting the group mean from each individual value, squaring the result, and summing the squared differences. We then sum these values across all groups to obtain the within-groups sum of squares.\nFinally, we divide the between-groups sum of squares by the within-groups sum of squares and compare the resulting F-statistic to a critical value from the F-distribution. If the F-statistic is greater than the critical value, we can reject the null hypothesis and conclude that there is a significant difference between the means of the groups.\nOne-way ANOVA is a useful tool for comparing the means of multiple groups, but it has some limitations. It is only appropriate for comparing the means of two or more groups, and it does not allow for comparisons between specific pairs of groups. Additionally, it does not provide information about which groups are significantly different from each other. To address these limitations, we can use follow-up tests such as the Tukey HSD test or the Bonferroni correction.\nIn summary, one-way ANOVA is a statistical test used to compare the means of two or more groups. It is important to ensure that the data meets the assumptions of the test and to use appropriate follow-up tests to understand the specific differences between groups.\nver3"

The study surveyed 200 patients with fibromyalgia and asked them to report their symptoms using a questionnaire. The questionnaire included questions about 19 different symptoms commonly associated with fibromyalgia, such as pain, fatigue, sleep disturbances, depression, and anxiety.\nWhen reporting the results, the authors used the _________ to describe the most common symptoms experienced by the patients. For example, they reported that the __________ for pain intensity was 7 (on a scale of 0 to 10), indicating that a pain intensity score of 7 was the most frequently reported by patients. The authors also reported the ___________ for each of the other 18 symptoms, such as the ___________ for fatigue severity, sleep quality, and anxiety level.\nUsing the ___________ in this study allowed the researchers to identify the symptoms that were most commonly reported by patients with fibromyalgia, which could help clinicians to better understand and manage the condition. The ___________ is an appropriate measure of central tendency in this study because it is useful for identifying the most frequently occurring value in a dataset, which can be important information for clinical decision-making.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\n\n\nmode\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn this study, the authors aimed to investigate the associations between physical activity, adiposity, cardiorespiratory fitness, and academic performance in a sample of Spanish youth. The authors used a cross-sectional design and recruited 1,700 children aged 6 to 18 years. The authors measured the children’s physical activity using self-report questionnaires, and they measured their adiposity using body mass index (BMI), waist circumference, and skinfold thickness. The authors also assessed the children’s cardiorespiratory fitness using a 20-m shuttle run test, and they measured academic performance using grade point averages.\nWhen reporting the results, the authors used the ___________ instead of the ___________ to describe the distribution of the physical activity and adiposity measures. For example, they reported the ___________ minutes per day spent in moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) instead of the ___________ MVPA. The authors chose to use the ___________ because the distributions of the physical activity and adiposity measures were skewed, meaning that a few extreme values could heavily influence the ___________.\nOverall, the study found that higher levels of physical activity, lower levels of adiposity, and higher levels of cardiorespiratory fitness were all positively associated with better academic performance in youth. The authors also found evidence to suggest that cardiorespiratory fitness mediated the relationship between physical activity and academic performance.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\n\n\nmedian, mean, median, mean, median, mean\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn this study, the authors aimed to investigate the effect of caffeine ingestion on tennis skill performance. The authors used a randomized, double-blind, crossover design and recruited 16 male tennis players. The players consumed either caffeine or a placebo before performing a tennis skill test, which consisted of serving, forehand, backhand, and volley. The authors measured the time to complete the skill test, the accuracy of the shots, and the total score of the test.\nWhen reporting the results, the authors used the ___________ instead of the ___________ to describe the central tendency of the data. For example, they reported the ___________ time to complete the skill test instead of the ___________ time. The authors chose to use the ___________ because the distributions of the skill test measures were approximately normal, meaning that the ___________ was a representative value of the data.\nOverall, the study found that caffeine ingestion improved tennis skill performance compared to the placebo condition. The authors found significant improvements in the time to complete the skill test, the accuracy of the shots, and the total score of the test. The authors concluded that caffeine ingestion may enhance tennis skill performance and could be used as an ergogenic aid in tennis.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\n\n\nmean, median, mean, median, mean, mean\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor exercises 4-6, fill the blank with either the Interquartile Range, Variance, Range, or Standard Deviation.\n\n\nn this study, the authors aimed to investigate the effect of protein supplementation combined with resistance training on muscle mass, strength, and function in individuals with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The authors conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials that evaluated the effect of protein supplementation and resistance training on COPD patients. The authors extracted data on muscle mass, strength, and function outcomes and calculated effect sizes using Hedges’ g.\nWhen reporting the results, the authors used the ___________ instead of the ____________ to describe the dispersion of the effect sizes. The authors chose to use the __________ because the effect size distributions were not normally distributed and contained outliers, which could heavily influence the _________ . The _________ is a more robust measure of dispersion that is less affected by outliers.\nOverall, the meta-analysis found that protein supplementation combined with resistance training was effective in improving muscle mass, strength, and function in individuals with COPD. The authors found significant improvements in the outcomes of muscle mass, strength, and function in the protein supplementation group compared to the control group. The authors concluded that protein supplementation combined with resistance training could be a promising intervention for improving muscle health in individuals with COPD.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\n\n\nIQR, Standard Deviation, IQR, Standard Deviation, IQR\nRecall that the SD should be reported instead of the variance since the former is aligned to the scale of the original data.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn this study, the authors aimed to investigate the relationship between physical activity and depressive symptoms in older women. The authors used a cross-sectional design and recruited 198 women aged 65 years and older. The authors measured the women’s physical activity using self-report questionnaires, and they assessed their depressive symptoms using the Geriatric Depression Scale.\nWhen reporting the results, the authors used the ___________ instead of the ____________ to describe the variability of the data. For example, they reported the ___________ of the physical activity levels instead of the ____________ of the physical activity levels. The authors chose to use the ___________ because the distributions of the physical activity levels and the depressive symptoms scores were skewed and had outliers, which could heavily influence the ____________.\nOverall, the study found a significant negative relationship between physical activity levels and depressive symptoms scores in older women. The authors also found that the relationship was strongest for moderate-intensity physical activity. The authors concluded that physical activity could be an effective non-pharmacological intervention for preventing and treating depressive symptoms in older women.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\n\n\nIQR, Standard Deviation, IQR, Standard Deviation, IQR, Standard Deviation\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn this study, the authors aimed to investigate the effect of resistance training frequency on neuromuscular performance and muscle morphology in trained men. The authors used a randomized controlled trial design and recruited 28 trained men. The men were randomly assigned to either a high-frequency resistance training group (six sessions per week) or a low-frequency resistance training group (three sessions per week). The authors measured the men’s neuromuscular performance using maximal isometric and dynamic strength tests, and they assessed the muscle morphology using muscle biopsies.\nWhen reporting the results, the authors used the ____________ instead of the ___________ to describe the variability of the data. For example, they reported the ____________ of the maximal isometric strength instead of the ___________ of the maximal isometric strength. The authors chose to use the ____________ because the distributions of the neuromuscular performance measures and the muscle morphology measures were approximately normal, meaning that the ____________ was a representative value of the data.\nOverall, the study found that the high-frequency resistance training group had greater improvements in neuromuscular performance and muscle morphology compared to the low-frequency resistance training group. The authors found significant increases in maximal isometric and dynamic strength, muscle cross-sectional area, and myofibrillar protein content in the high-frequency group. The authors concluded that high-frequency resistance training could be a superior training strategy for enhancing neuromuscular performance and muscle morphology in trained men.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\n\n\nStandard Deviation, IQR or Range, Standard Deviation, IQR, Standard Deviation, Standard Deviation"

Use the code chunk header {r set-up, include = FALSE} to suppress this set up code.\n\nknitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE,\n                      warning = FALSE, \n                      message = FALSE)\n\n\nHeaders\n\nUse headers to clearly label each section.\nInspect the document outline to review your headers and sub-headers.\n\n\n\nReferences\n\nInclude all references in a section called “References” at the end of the report.\nThis course does not have specific requirements for formatting citations and references.\n\n\n\nAppendix\n\nIf you have additional work that does not fit or does not belong in the body of the report, you may put it at the end of the document in section called “Appendix”.\nThe items in the appendix should be properly labeled.\nThe appendix should only be for additional material. The reader should be able to fully understand your report without viewing content in the appendix.\n\n\n\nResize figures\nResize plots and figures, so you have more space for the narrative.\n\n\nArranging plots\nArrange plots in a grid, instead of one after the other. This is especially useful when displaying plots for exploratory data analysis and to check assumptions.\nIf you’re using ggplot2 functions, the patchwork package makes it easy to arrange plots in a grid. See the documentation and examples here.\n\n\nPlot titles and axis labels\nBe sure all plot titles and axis labels are visible and easy to read.\n\nUse informative titles, not variable names, for titles and axis labels.\n\n❌ NO! The x-axis is hard to read because the names overlap.\n\nggplot(data = mpg, aes(x = manufacturer)) +\n  geom_bar()\n\n\n\n\n✅ YES! Names are readable\n\nggplot(data = mpg, aes(y = manufacturer)) +\n  geom_bar()\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDo a little more to make the plot look professional!\n\nInformative title and axis labels\nFlipped coordinates to make names readable\nArranged bars based on count\nCapitalized manufacturer names\nOptional: Added color - Use a coordinated color scheme throughout paper / presentation\nOptional: Applied a theme - Use same theme throughout paper / presentation\n\n\nmpg %>%\n  count(manufacturer) %>%\n  mutate(manufacturer = str_to_title(manufacturer)) %>%\n  ggplot(aes(y = fct_reorder(manufacturer,n), x = n)) +\n  geom_bar(stat = \"identity\", fill = \"steelblue\") +\n  labs(x = \"Manufacturer\", \n       y = \"Count\", \n       title = \"The most common manufacturer is Dodge\") +\n  theme_minimal() \n\n\n\n\n\n\nTables and model output\n\nUse the kable function from the knitr package to neatly output all tables and model output. This will also ensure all model coefficients are displayed.\n\nUse the digits argument to display only 3 or 4 significant digits.\nUse the caption argument to add captions to your table.\n\n\n\nmodel <- lm(mpg ~ hp, data = mtcars)\ntidy(model) %>%\n  kable(digits = 3)\n\n\n\n\nterm\nestimate\nstd.error\nstatistic\np.value\n\n\n\n\n(Intercept)\n30.099\n1.634\n18.421\n0\n\n\nhp\n-0.068\n0.010\n-6.742\n0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGuidelines for communicating results\n\nDon’t use variable names in your narrative! Use descriptive terms, so the reader understands your narrative without relying on the data dictionary.\n\n❌ There is a negative linear relationship between mpg and hp.\n✅ There is a negative linear relationship between a car’s fuel economy (in miles per gallon) and its horsepower.\n\nKnow your audience: Your report should be written for a general audience who has an understanding of statistics at the level of STA 210.\nAvoid subject matter jargon: Don’t assume the audience knows all of the specific terminology related to your subject area. If you must use jargon, include a brief definition the first time you introduce a term.\nTell the “so what”: Your report and presentation should be more than a list of interpretations and technical definitions. Focus on what the results mean, i.e. what you want the audience to know about your topic after reading your report or viewing your presentation.\n\n❌ For every one unit increase in horsepower, we expect the miles per gallon to decrease by 0.068 units, on average.\n✅ If the priority is to have good fuel economy, then one should choose a car with lower horsepower. Based on our model, the fuel economy is expected to decrease, on average, by 0.68 miles per gallon for every 10 additional horsepower.\n\nTell a story: All visualizations, tables, model output, and narrative should tell a cohesive story!\nUse one voice: Though multiple people are writing the report, it should read as if it’s from a single author. At least one team member should read through the report before submission to ensure it reads like a cohesive document."

For example, the 75th percentile is the value below which 75% of the values in a dataset fall.\nPercentile rank, on the other hand, is a measure of the relative position of a score within a distribution of scores. It indicates the percentage of scores that are equal to or below a given score. For example, if a score has a percentile rank of 75, it means that 75% of the scores in the distribution are equal to or below that score.\nIn essence, percentile rank uses percentiles to determine the relative position of a score within a dataset.

The study surveyed 200 patients with fibromyalgia and asked them to report their symptoms using a questionnaire. The questionnaire included questions about 19 different symptoms commonly associated with fibromyalgia, such as pain, fatigue, sleep disturbances, depression, and anxiety.\nWhen reporting the results, the authors used the _________ to describe the most common symptoms experienced by the patients. For example, they reported that the __________ for pain intensity was 7 (on a scale of 0 to 10), indicating that a pain intensity score of 7 was the most frequently reported by patients. The authors also reported the ___________ for each of the other 18 symptoms, such as the ___________ for fatigue severity, sleep quality, and anxiety level.\nUsing the ___________ in this study allowed the researchers to identify the symptoms that were most commonly reported by patients with fibromyalgia, which could help clinicians to better understand and manage the condition. The ___________ is an appropriate measure of central tendency in this study because it is useful for identifying the most frequently occurring value in a dataset, which can be important information for clinical decision-making.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\n\n\nmode\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn this study, the authors aimed to investigate the associations between physical activity, adiposity, cardiorespiratory fitness, and academic performance in a sample of Spanish youth. The authors used a cross-sectional design and recruited 1,700 children aged 6 to 18 years. The authors measured the children’s physical activity using self-report questionnaires, and they measured their adiposity using body mass index (BMI), waist circumference, and skinfold thickness. The authors also assessed the children’s cardiorespiratory fitness using a 20-m shuttle run test, and they measured academic performance using grade point averages.\nWhen reporting the results, the authors used the ___________ instead of the ___________ to describe the distribution of the physical activity and adiposity measures. For example, they reported the ___________ minutes per day spent in moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) instead of the ___________ MVPA. The authors chose to use the ___________ because the distributions of the physical activity and adiposity measures were skewed, meaning that a few extreme values could heavily influence the ___________.\nOverall, the study found that higher levels of physical activity, lower levels of adiposity, and higher levels of cardiorespiratory fitness were all positively associated with better academic performance in youth. The authors also found evidence to suggest that cardiorespiratory fitness mediated the relationship between physical activity and academic performance.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\n\n\nmedian, mean, median, mean, median, mean\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn this study, the authors aimed to investigate the effect of caffeine ingestion on tennis skill performance. The authors used a randomized, double-blind, crossover design and recruited 16 male tennis players. The players consumed either caffeine or a placebo before performing a tennis skill test, which consisted of serving, forehand, backhand, and volley. The authors measured the time to complete the skill test, the accuracy of the shots, and the total score of the test.\nWhen reporting the results, the authors used the ___________ instead of the ___________ to describe the central tendency of the data. For example, they reported the ___________ time to complete the skill test instead of the ___________ time. The authors chose to use the ___________ because the distributions of the skill test measures were approximately normal, meaning that the ___________ was a representative value of the data.\nOverall, the study found that caffeine ingestion improved tennis skill performance compared to the placebo condition. The authors found significant improvements in the time to complete the skill test, the accuracy of the shots, and the total score of the test. The authors concluded that caffeine ingestion may enhance tennis skill performance and could be used as an ergogenic aid in tennis.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\n\n\nmean, median, mean, median, mean, mean\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor exercises 4-6, fill the blank with either the Interquartile Range, Variance, Range, or Standard Deviation.\n\n\nn this study, the authors aimed to investigate the effect of protein supplementation combined with resistance training on muscle mass, strength, and function in individuals with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The authors conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials that evaluated the effect of protein supplementation and resistance training on COPD patients. The authors extracted data on muscle mass, strength, and function outcomes and calculated effect sizes using Hedges’ g.\nWhen reporting the results, the authors used the ___________ instead of the ____________ to describe the dispersion of the effect sizes. The authors chose to use the __________ because the effect size distributions were not normally distributed and contained outliers, which could heavily influence the _________ . The _________ is a more robust measure of dispersion that is less affected by outliers.\nOverall, the meta-analysis found that protein supplementation combined with resistance training was effective in improving muscle mass, strength, and function in individuals with COPD. The authors found significant improvements in the outcomes of muscle mass, strength, and function in the protein supplementation group compared to the control group. The authors concluded that protein supplementation combined with resistance training could be a promising intervention for improving muscle health in individuals with COPD.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\n\n\nIQR, Standard Deviation, IQR, Standard Deviation, IQR\nRecall that the SD should be reported instead of the variance since the former is aligned to the scale of the original data.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn this study, the authors aimed to investigate the relationship between physical activity and depressive symptoms in older women. The authors used a cross-sectional design and recruited 198 women aged 65 years and older. The authors measured the women’s physical activity using self-report questionnaires, and they assessed their depressive symptoms using the Geriatric Depression Scale.\nWhen reporting the results, the authors used the ___________ instead of the ____________ to describe the variability of the data. For example, they reported the ___________ of the physical activity levels instead of the ____________ of the physical activity levels. The authors chose to use the ___________ because the distributions of the physical activity levels and the depressive symptoms scores were skewed and had outliers, which could heavily influence the ____________.\nOverall, the study found a significant negative relationship between physical activity levels and depressive symptoms scores in older women. The authors also found that the relationship was strongest for moderate-intensity physical activity. The authors concluded that physical activity could be an effective non-pharmacological intervention for preventing and treating depressive symptoms in older women.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\n\n\nIQR, Standard Deviation, IQR, Standard Deviation, IQR, Standard Deviation\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn this study, the authors aimed to investigate the effect of resistance training frequency on neuromuscular performance and muscle morphology in trained men. The authors used a randomized controlled trial design and recruited 28 trained men. The men were randomly assigned to either a high-frequency resistance training group (six sessions per week) or a low-frequency resistance training group (three sessions per week). The authors measured the men’s neuromuscular performance using maximal isometric and dynamic strength tests, and they assessed the muscle morphology using muscle biopsies.\nWhen reporting the results, the authors used the ____________ instead of the ___________ to describe the variability of the data. For example, they reported the ____________ of the maximal isometric strength instead of the ___________ of the maximal isometric strength. The authors chose to use the ____________ because the distributions of the neuromuscular performance measures and the muscle morphology measures were approximately normal, meaning that the ____________ was a representative value of the data.\nOverall, the study found that the high-frequency resistance training group had greater improvements in neuromuscular performance and muscle morphology compared to the low-frequency resistance training group. The authors found significant increases in maximal isometric and dynamic strength, muscle cross-sectional area, and myofibrillar protein content in the high-frequency group. The authors concluded that high-frequency resistance training could be a superior training strategy for enhancing neuromuscular performance and muscle morphology in trained men.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\n\n\nStandard Deviation, IQR or Range, Standard Deviation, IQR, Standard Deviation, Standard Deviation"

    "text": "Parametric tests are a class of statistical tests that make assumptions about the underlying probability distribution of the data being analyzed. These assumptions include that the data are sampled from a population that follows a normal distribution, and that the sample size is large enough to make these assumptions valid. The most commonly used parametric tests include t-tests, ANOVA (analysis of variance) and multiple regression analysis. These tests are known to have more powerful results than non-parametric tests, which makes them more useful for exploring the difference between groups or testing hypotheses about a population.\nThe assumptions of parametric tests are met when the data are approximately normal and when the sample size is large enough. Therefore, it is recommended to check for normality of the data using normality test such as the Shapiro-Wilk test and check for outliers using box plots and histograms.\nParametric tests are useful when the researcher wants to compare means of two or more groups, establish a relationship between two or more variables, or investigate the correlation between variables. Examples of parametric tests include: t-test, ANOVA, multiple regression analysis, and chi-square tests.\n\n\n\\[\nt = \\frac{\\bar{x} - \\mu}{\\frac{s}{\\sqrt{n}}}\n\\tag{1}\\]\nwhere:\n\n\\(\\bar{x}\\) is the sample mean\n\\(\\mu\\) is the population mean\n\\(s\\) is the sample standard deviation\n\\(n\\) is the sample size\n\nIt also can be written as:\n\\[\nt = \\frac{\\bar{x} - \\mu}{s_x/\\sqrt{n}}\n\\tag{2}\\]\nwhere:\n\n\\(\\bar{x}\\) is the sample mean\n\\(\\mu\\) is the population mean\n\\(s_x\\) is the sample standard deviation\n\\(n\\) is the sample size\n\n\n\nThe one-sample t-test should be run when you have a single sample of data and you want to compare the mean of that sample to a known or hypothesized population mean.\nExample in kinesiology: A kinesiologist wants to know if a new exercise program improves muscle strength in older adults. The kinesiologist recruits a sample of 20 older adults and has them complete the exercise program for 8 weeks. The kinesiologist measures muscle strength using a dynamometer before and after the 8 week program. The kinesiologist wants to know if the mean muscle strength of the sample is significantly different from the population mean muscle strength of older adults (which is hypothesized to be 40 kg). The kinesiologist would run a one-sample t-test to compare the mean muscle strength of the sample (after completing the exercise program) to the hypothesized population mean of 40 kg. If the t-value is significant, the kinesiologist can conclude that the exercise program does improve muscle strength in older adults.\n\n\n\nThe test makes several assumptions about the data:\n\nIndependence: The observations in the sample are independent of one another.\nNormality: The population from which the sample is drawn is normally distributed.\nEqual variances: The population variances of the two groups are equal.\nRandom sampling: The sample is drawn randomly and independently from the population.\nSample size: The sample size is large enough (usually greater than 30) for the Central Limit Theorem to be applied.\n\nIt is important to check these assumptions before running the one-sample t-test to ensure the validity of the test results. In case the sample size is small or the data distribution is not normal, a non-parametric test such as the Wilcoxon signed-rank test should be used instead.\n\n\n\nWhen reporting the results of a one-sample t-test in APA style, you should include the following information:\n\nThe test statistic and the associated degrees of freedom (df). For example: “t(df) = 2.45, p = .03.”\nThe p-value of the test. This should be rounded to two decimal places and reported as a probability (e.g., “p = .03” rather than “p < .05”).\nThe sample size (n). This should be reported as a whole number (e.g., “n = 20”).\nThe mean and standard deviation of the sample. For example: “M = 5.6, SD = 1.2.”\nThe direction of the effect. For example, “The mean score was significantly higher than the hypothesized mean (M = 4.0, t(df) = 2.45, p = .03).”\nAny relevant effect size measures. For example, you might report the Cohen’s d effect size as “d = 0.87.”\n\nIt is also good practice to include a brief description of the research question or hypothesis being tested, as well as a description of the sample and any relevant study variables.\nFor example: “In this study, we tested the hypothesis that the mean score on a memory task would be significantly higher than 4.0. A sample of 20 participants completed the task, with a mean score of 5.6 (SD = 1.2). The one-sample t-test revealed a significant difference, t(df) = 2.45, p = .03, d = 0.87, indicating that the mean score was significantly higher than the hypothesized mean.”\n\n\n\nThe results of the one-sample t test indicated that the mean (M = X, SD = Y) was significantly different from the hypothesized value (t(df) = t-value, p < .05).\nIn a one-sample t test, the mean of the sample was significantly different from the hypothesized mean (t(df) = t-value, p < .05). Specifically, the mean of the sample was X (SD = standard deviation) while the hypothesized mean was Y.\nThe results of the one-sample t test indicated that the mean of the sample (M = X, SD = Y) was significantly different from the hypothesized mean (μ = t) t(df) = t-value, p < .05.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe independent-samples t-test should be run when comparing the means of two independent groups. For example, in the field of kinesiology, an independent-samples t-test can be used to compare the muscle strength of a group of individuals who have completed a resistance training program to a group of individuals who have not completed a resistance training program. The independent variable would be whether or not the individual completed the resistance training program and the dependent variable would be muscle strength. The t-test would be used to determine if there is a significant difference in muscle strength between the two groups, indicating that the resistance training program had an effect on muscle strength.\n\n\n\nThe assumptions of the independent-samples t-test include:\n\nNormality: The data should be approximately normally distributed within each group.\nIndependence: The observations in each group should be independent of one another.\nEqual variances: The variances of the two groups should be roughly equal.\nRandom Sampling: The sample of each group should be random and representative of the population.\nEqual sample size: The sample size in each group should be equal or similar.\n\nIt is important to note that not all these assumptions need to be perfectly met for the test to be valid, but the deviations from these assumptions should be small. If the data do not meet these assumptions, the non-parametric version of the independent-samples t-test, such as the Mann-Whitney U test, can be used instead.\n\n\n\nTo report the results of an independent samples t-test in APA style, you should include the following information:\n\nThe type of test that was conducted (e.g., “An independent samples t-test was conducted to compare the mean scores of two groups on a measure of stress.”)\nThe sample size for each group (e.g., “The sample consisted of 20 participants in Group A and 25 participants in Group B.”)\nThe mean and standard deviation for each group (e.g., “The mean score for Group A was M = 3.5, SD = 1.2, and the mean score for Group B was M = 2.8, SD = 0.9.”)\nThe t-value and p-value obtained from the test (e.g., “The t-value was t(43) = 2.3, p = .03, indicating that there was a significant difference between the mean scores of the two groups, with Group A scoring higher than Group B.”)\nThe effect size (e.g., “The effect size for the difference between the two groups was d = .7, indicating a moderate effect.”)\n\nIt is also a good idea to provide a brief interpretation of the results, explaining what they mean in the context of your research question or hypothesis.\nHere is an example of how you might report the results of an independent samples t-test in APA style:\n\n\n\n“An independent samples t-test was conducted to compare the mean scores of two groups on a measure of stress. The sample consisted of 20 participants in Group A and 25 participants in Group B. The mean score for Group A was M = 3.5, SD = 1.2, and the mean score for Group B was M = 2.8, SD = 0.9. The t-value was t(43) = 2.3, p = .03, indicating that there was a significant difference between the mean scores of the two groups, with Group A scoring higher than Group B. The effect size for the difference between the two groups was d = .7, indicating a moderate effect. These results suggest that participants in Group A experienced significantly higher levels of stress than those in Group B.”\n“The purpose of this study was to examine the effect of a new teaching method on student achievement. A sample of 50 students was randomly assigned to either the experimental group, which received the new teaching method, or the control group, which received the traditional teaching method. Student achievement was measured using a standardized test. The results of the independent samples t-test showed that there was a statistically significant difference between the experimental and control groups, t(48) = 2.57, p = .01. The experimental group had a higher mean score on the achievement test than the control group. These findings suggest that the new teaching method was effective in improving student achievement. However, it is important to note that the small sample size and lack of generalizability to other populations are limitations of this study.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe paired-samples t-test should be run when you have two sets of related (or paired) data that you want to compare. For example, if you want to compare the effectiveness of two different treatments on a group of patients, you would use a paired-samples t-test. This test is also commonly used in pre- and post-test designs, where you want to compare scores before and after an intervention or treatment. Additionally, if you want to compare the mean differences between two groups or conditions, but you want to control for individual differences, you can use a paired-samples t-test.\n\n\n\nThe assumptions of the paired-samples t-test include:\n\nIndependence: The observations within each pair are independent of one another.\nNormality: The differences between the pairs of observations are approximately normally distributed.\nEqual variances: The variances of the differences between the pairs of observations are equal.\nPaired data: The observations are paired, meaning that each individual is measured twice, once before and once after some intervention, or in two different conditions.\nRandom Sampling: The sample being used is selected randomly from the population.\n\nIt’s important to note that violations of these assumptions may lead to inaccurate results, so it’s necessary to check them before applying the test. Checking for normality can be done using a normal probability plot, and checking for equal variances can be done using Levene’s test. The paired sample t-test is sensitive to the violation of normality and equal variances assumptions, thus if the assumptions are not met, there are other options that can be used, such as the Wilcoxon signed-rank test which is a non-parametric version of the paired-samples t-test.\n\n\n\nWhen reporting the results of a paired-samples t-test, it is important to include the following information:\n\nThe test statistic (e.g. t-value) and the associated p-value. The t-value tells us how many standard errors the mean difference is from zero, and the p-value tells us the probability of observing a t-value as extreme as the one we calculated under the assumption that the null hypothesis is true.\nThe sample size (e.g. the number of pairs of observations).\nThe mean difference and the standard deviation of the differences.\nThe effect size, such as Cohen’s d, which is a measure of the magnitude of the difference between the means.\n\nExample:\n“A paired-samples t-test was conducted to compare the pre-test and post-test scores of a group of students. The sample size was 20 pairs of observations. The mean difference between the pre-test and post-test scores was 5.3 (SD = 2.5). The t-value was 3.87, with a p-value of 0.001. The effect size (Cohen’s d) was 0.67, which indicates a moderate effect size.”\n“The results of the paired-samples t-test revealed that there was a statistically significant difference between the pre-test and post-test scores of the students, t(19) = 3.87, p = 0.001. The mean difference was 5.3 (95% CI [3.4, 7.2]), and the effect size (d = 0.67) suggests moderate effect size.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA one-way ANOVA (Analysis of Variance) is used to test for differences in the mean of a continuous outcome variable across two or more categorical groups. It is used when you have one independent variable (also known as a factor) with two or more levels or groups and one continuous dependent variable.\nIn other words, you should run a one-way ANOVA when:\n\nYou want to compare the means of a continuous outcome variable across two or more groups.\nYou have one independent variable (factor) with two or more levels or groups\nThe dependent variable is continuous\n\nExample: A researcher wants to know if there is a difference in the mean test scores of students who studied using different methods (Method A, Method B, Method C). The researcher collect data on test scores and the method used. The test scores are continuous variable and method of study is categorical variable with 3 levels. So, the researcher can use one-way ANOVA to test for the difference in mean test scores across different method of study.\n\n\n\nThe one-way ANOVA (analysis of variance) makes several assumptions about the data being analyzed:\n\nIndependence: The observations in each group are independent of each other and do not affect the observations in the other groups.\nNormality: The data within each group is normally distributed, or at least approximately normally distributed. This assumption can be checked using normality tests such as the Shapiro-Wilk test.\nEqual variances: The variances of the data within each group are equal. This assumption can be checked using tests such as the Levene’s test.\nRandom sampling: The data are randomly sampled from the population, so that the sample is representative of the population.\n\nViolations of these assumptions can lead to biased or incorrect results. If the assumptions are not met, non-parametric alternatives such as Kruskal-Wallis test could be used.\n\n\n\nWhen reporting the results of a one-way ANOVA, it is important to include the following information:\n\nThe F-value and the associated p-value. The F-value tells us how much variation in the dependent variable is accounted for by the independent variable, and the p-value tells us the probability of observing an F-value as extreme as the one we calculated under the assumption that the null hypothesis is true.\nThe sample size for each group, or the number of observations in each group.\nThe means and standard deviations for each group.\nThe effect size, such as eta-squared (η²) or omega-squared (ω²), which is a measure of the proportion of variance in the dependent variable that is accounted for by the independent variable.\n\nExample:\n“A one-way ANOVA was conducted to compare the scores of three groups of students on a test. The sample size for each group was 10, 10, and 12. The means and standard deviations for each group were: Group 1 = 80 (SD = 5), Group 2 = 75 (SD = 4), Group 3 = 70 (SD = 3). The F-value was 12.5, with a p-value of 0.001. The effect size (η²) was 0.17, which indicates a moderate effect size.”\n“The results of the one-way ANOVA revealed that there was a statistically significant difference between the scores of the three groups of students, F(2, 28) = 12.5, p = 0.001. Post-hoc comparisons revealed that group 1 significantly different from group 2 (p = 0.05) and group 3 (p = 0.001). The mean scores for each group were: Group 1 = 80 (95% CI [78, 82]), Group 2 = 75 (95% CI [73, 77]), Group 3 = 70 (95% CI [69, 72]). The effect size (η² = 0.17) suggests that the independent variable accounted for a moderate proportion of variance in the dependent variable.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou should run a Between-subjects Two-way ANOVA when you have two independent variables (also known as factors) that you want to test the effect of on a dependent variable, and the levels of these independent variables are different between groups of participants.\nAn example related to physical activity could be comparing the effect of two different types of exercise programs (e.g. resistance training vs. cardio) on muscle mass gain in two different age groups (e.g. older adults vs. younger adults). In this example, the independent variables would be the type of exercise program and the age group, and the dependent variable would be muscle mass gain. The levels of the independent variables would be different between groups of participants, as the older adults would be in one group and the younger adults would be in another. A Between-subjects Two-way ANOVA would allow you to test for any interactions between the two independent variables (i.e. whether the effect of the exercise program on muscle mass gain is different in older adults vs. younger adults) and any main effects of each independent variable on the dependent variable.\n\n\n\nThe assumptions of the between-subjects two-way ANOVA are as follows:\n\nIndependence: The observations in each group are independent of each other, meaning that the responses of one participant do not affect the responses of another participant.\nNormality: The distribution of the residuals (the difference between the observed and predicted values) is approximately normal. It is important to check the normality assumptions using normality test such as the Shapiro-Wilk test and check for outliers using box plots and histograms.\nEqual variances: The variances of the residuals are equal across all groups and levels of the independent variables. This assumption can be checked using Levene’s test for equality of variances.\nAdditivity: The effect of each independent variable on the dependent variable is additive, meaning that the effect of one independent variable does not depend on the level of the other independent variable.\nLinearity: The relationship between the independent variables and the dependent variable is linear, meaning that a straight line can be used to represent the relationship.\nIndependence of errors: the residuals are independent, meaning that the residuals of one observation are not correlated with the residuals of any other observation.\n\nIt’s important to note that when these assumptions are not met, the results of the ANOVA should be interpreted with caution and alternative methods of analysis should be considered.\n\n\n\nWhen reporting the results of a between-subjects Two-way ANOVA, you should include the following information:\n\nA description of the study design, including the independent variables, dependent variable, and the levels of each independent variable.\nThe results of the ANOVA, including the F-value, degrees of freedom, and p-value for each independent variable and any interaction between the two independent variables.\nA summary of the main findings, including any significant main effects or interactions between the independent variables.\nFollow-up tests, such as post-hoc tests, to determine which specific levels of the independent variables were responsible for the significant effects.\n\nExample:\n“The study aimed to examine the effect of two different types of physical education programs (e.g. traditional vs. adventure-based) on physical fitness in two different age groups (e.g. younger children vs. older children). A between-subjects Two-way ANOVA was conducted, with the independent variables being the type of program and the age group, and the dependent variable being physical fitness. The results of the ANOVA showed a significant main effect of the type of program, F (1, 48) = 8.32, p = 0.006, with the adventure-based program resulting in higher physical fitness scores than the traditional program. A significant interaction was also found between the type of program and the age group, F (1, 48) = 4.12, p = 0.047. Follow-up tests showed that the adventure-based program resulted in significantly higher physical fitness scores in older children compared to the traditional program, but there was no significant difference in younger children.”\n\n\n\n\nYou should run a Within-subjects Two-way ANOVA when you have two independent variables (also known as factors) that you want to test the effect of on a dependent variable, and the levels of these independent variables are the same for all participants, but are manipulated within each participant.\nAn example related to motor skill learning could be comparing the effect of two different types of feedback (e.g. verbal vs. visual) on the learning of a new motor skill (e.g. throwing a ball) in a group of participants. In this example, the independent variables would be the type of feedback and the time of testing (e.g. pre-test and post-test), and the dependent variable would be the accuracy of the throwing skill. The levels of the independent variables would be the same for all participants, as each participant would receive both types of feedback and be tested both before and after training. A Within-subjects Two-way ANOVA would allow you to test for any interactions between the two independent variables (i.e. whether the effect of feedback on motor skill learning is different at the pre-test vs. the post-test) and any main effects of each independent variable on the dependent variable.\n\n\nThe assumptions of the within-subjects two-way ANOVA (also known as a repeated-measures ANOVA) include:\n\nIndependence: The observations within each cell of the design must be independent of one another.\nNormality: The observations within each cell should be approximately normally distributed.\nEqual variances: The variances of the observations within each cell should be approximately equal.\nSphericity: The variances of the differences between the observations for each condition should be approximately equal across the levels of the other independent variable. This assumption is often tested using Mauchly’s test.\nNo carryover effects: There should be no carryover effects from one level of one independent variable to the next level of the same independent variable.\nNo missing data: There should be no missing data in the dataset.\n\nIt is important to note that when the assumptions of the within-subjects two-way ANOVA are not met, the results may not be reliable and alternative methods such as mixed-design ANOVA or non-parametric methods may be needed.\n\n\n\nWhen reporting the results of a within-subjects Two-way ANOVA, you should first indicate the dependent variable, the independent variables and the levels of each independent variable. You should then report the main effect of each independent variable on the dependent variable, as well as any interaction effects between the independent variables.\nFor example, if you were studying the effect of two different types of practice schedules (random vs. blocked) and two different types of feedback (verbal vs. visual) on motor skill learning, your report would look something like this:\nDependent variable: Motor skill learning Independent variables: Practice schedule (random vs. blocked) and feedback (verbal vs. visual)\nMain Effects:\n\nPractice schedule: There was a significant main effect of practice schedule on motor skill learning, F(1,24) = 7.32, p = .012, ηp² = .234, such that participants who practiced in a random schedule showed better motor skill learning than those who practiced in a blocked schedule.\nFeedback: There was a significant main effect of feedback on motor skill learning, F(1,24) = 4.56, p = .045, ηp² = .158, such that participants who received visual feedback showed better motor skill learning than those who received verbal feedback.\n\nInteraction Effects:\n\nThere was no significant interaction between practice schedule and feedback on motor skill learning, F(1,24) = .21, p = .65, ηp² = .009.\n\nIt is worth noting that p values less than 0.05 would be considered statistically significant, and ηp² indicates the effect size of the interaction effects.\nIt is also important to report the means and standard deviations of the dependent variable within each level of the independent variables. This will give a more detailed understanding of the pattern of results.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou should run a mixed-factors two-way ANOVA when you have two independent variables (also known as factors) that you want to test the effect of on a dependent variable, and one of the independent variables is a between-subjects variable and the other is a within-subjects variable.\nA mixed-factors two-way ANOVA is useful when you want to examine the effect of a manipulation that varies within subjects (e.g. different levels of a treatment) while also taking into account individual differences among participants (e.g. gender, age, etc.).\nAn example of when to run a mixed-factors two-way ANOVA would be if you wanted to investigate the effect of two different types of exercise programs (e.g. resistance training vs. cardio) on muscle mass gain in two different age groups (e.g. older adults vs. younger adults) but the program is applied to the same group of people. In this example, the independent variables would be the type of exercise program (between-subjects) and the age group (within-subjects) and the dependent variable would be muscle mass gain.\nA mixed-factors two-way ANOVA would allow you to test for any interactions between the two independent variables, and any main effects of each independent variable on the dependent variable, while also taking into account the individual differences among participants.\n\n\n\nThe assumptions of the mixed-factors two-way ANOVA (also known as a mixed-design two-way ANOVA) include:\n\nIndependence of observations: Each participant’s response should be independent of the responses of other participants.\nNormality: The residuals (the difference between the observed and predicted values) should be approximately normally distributed.\nEqual variances: The variances of the residuals should be equal across all levels of the independent variables.\nSphericity: The variances of the differences between the levels of the within-subjects variable should be equal.\nLinearity: The relationship between the independent and dependent variables should be linear.\nAdditivity: The effect of each independent variable should be additive, meaning that the effect of one variable should not depend on the level of the other variable.\n\nIt’s important to note that the violation of these assumptions can lead to inaccurate results, therefore, it’s important to check them by using various graphical methods, like box plots, histograms and Q-Q plots, and statistical methods like Shapiro-Wilk test, Levene’s test, and Mauchly’s test.\n\n\n\nWhen reporting the results of a mixed-factors Two-way ANOVA, you should include the following information:\n\nA description of the study design, including the independent variables, dependent variable, and the levels of each independent variable. Specify which variable is the within-subject variable and which one is the between-subject variable.\nThe results of the ANOVA, including the F-value, degrees of freedom, and p-value for each independent variable and any interaction between the two independent variables.\nA summary of the main findings, including any significant main effects or interactions between the independent variables.\nFollow-up tests, such as post-hoc tests, to determine which specific levels of the independent variables were responsible for the significant effects.\n\nExample:\n“The study aimed to examine the effect of two different types of motor development programs (e.g. traditional vs. adventure-based) on balance skills in two different age groups (e.g. preschool children vs. school-aged children). A mixed-factors Two-way ANOVA was conducted, with the independent variables being time (within-subject variable) and the age group (between-subject variable) and the dependent variable being balance skills. The results of the ANOVA showed a significant main effect of time, F (1, 48) = 8.32, p = 0.006, with post-test resulting in higher balance skills scores than pretest. A significant interaction was also found between time and the age group, F (1, 48) = 4.12, p = 0.047. Follow-up tests showed that post-test resulted in significantly higher balance skills scores in preschool children compared to pre-test, but there was no significant difference in school-aged children.”\nIt is important to note that in a mixed-factors ANOVA, the assumptions of normality and equal variances are tested at each level of the within-subject variable separately.\n\n\n\n\nThe Pearson correlation coefficient (r) is used to measure the strength and direction of the linear relationship between two continuous variables. It is appropriate to use when you want to determine if there is a linear relationship between two variables and the data are at least interval level. It is important to note that the Pearson correlation coefficient only measures linear relationships, and it is not appropriate to use if the relationship between the variables is non-linear.\nIt is generally considered appropriate to use the Pearson correlation coefficient when the following conditions are met:\n\nThe data for both variables is continuous (i.e., interval or ratio level).\nBoth variables are normally distributed or the sample size is large enough (n>30)\nThe variables are not categorical\nThe data are free from outliers\nThe relationship between the two variables is believed to be linear\n\nIt’s also worth noting that the Pearson correlation coefficient assumes that there is no causality between the two variables, it just measures the association between them. If you want to establish causality, you should use other statistical techniques such as regression analysis.\n\n\nWhen reporting the results of a Pearson correlation coefficient, it is important to include the following information:\n\nThe correlation coefficient (r) and the associated p-value. The correlation coefficient tells us the strength and direction of the linear relationship between two variables, and the p-value tells us the probability of observing a correlation coefficient as extreme as the one we calculated under the assumption that there is no correlation.\nThe sample size (e.g. the number of observations)\nThe scatter plot of the data with the line of best fit and the equation of that line.\nThe effect size, such as Cohen’s d, which is a measure of the magnitude of the correlation.\n\nExample:\n“A Pearson correlation coefficient was calculated to examine the relationship between hours of sleep and test scores of a group of students. The sample size was 30. The correlation coefficient was 0.75, with a p-value of 0.001. The scatter plot of the data with the line of best fit showing a positive correlation and equation of the line y = 0.5x+50 . The effect size (Cohen’s d) was 0.5, which indicates a moderate effect size.”\n“The results of the Pearson correlation coefficient revealed a statistically significant positive correlation between hours of sleep and test scores of the students (r(28) = 0.75, p = 0.001). The scatter plot of the data with the line of best fit y = 0.5x+50 illustrates the positive correlation. The effect size (d = 0.5) suggests a moderate correlation.”"

This test is used when the assumptions of a parametric test such as the independent t-test cannot be met. These assumptions include normality of the data and equal variances between groups.\n\n\nThe Mann-Whitney U test is equivalent to the Independent-Samples t-test.\nThe Mann-Whitney U test is particularly useful when the data are not normally distributed, when the sample size is small, or when the data have outliers. It is also used when the data are ordinal or non-normally distributed, and when the variances of the two groups are not equal.\nAn example of when to run the Mann-Whitney U test is when you want to compare the muscle mass gain of two groups of athletes, one group using a new supplement, and the other using a placebo. The muscle mass gain is measured in kilograms and the sample size is small(less than 30), thus, it would be appropriate to use the Mann-Whitney U test to determine if there is a significant difference in muscle mass gain between the two groups.\n\nAssumptions\nThe Mann-Whitney U test is a non-parametric test that is used to compare the medians of two independent groups. In order for the test to be valid, the following assumptions must be met:\n\nIndependence: The observations in each group must be independent of one another. This means that there should be no relationship between the observations within a group.\nOrdinal or continuous data: The data must be ordinal or continuous in nature. The Mann-Whitney U test cannot be used for categorical or discrete data.\nNo ties: There should be no ties in the data.

Outliers are observations that are far away from the rest of the data and can have a strong impact on the results of the test.\nNo normal distribution: The data do not need to follow a normal distribution, which makes the test a good option when dealing with non-normal data.\nSame population : The two groups being compared should be sampled from the same population.\n\nIt is important to check for these assumptions before running the test and report the results accordingly.\n\n\nReporting results\nWhen reporting the results of a Mann-Whitney U test, you should include the following information:\n\nA brief description of the test and its purpose.\nThe test statistic (U) and the p-value.\nA statement about the outcome of the test, such as whether the null hypothesis was rejected or not.\nA summary of the main findings, such as the differences in the two groups being compared.\nA visual representation of the data, such as box plots or histograms, to help users understand the results.\n\nExample:\n“Mann-Whitney U Test\nPurpose: To compare the differences in physical activity levels between two groups of individuals (e.g. active vs. sedentary).\nTest statistic: U = 50\np-value: 0.03\nOutcome: The null hypothesis is rejected.\nFindings: The active group had significantly higher physical activity levels than the sedentary group.\nVisual representation: A box plot is shown to help the user understand the distribution of physical activity levels in the two groups. The active group has a higher median value and a smaller interquartile range than the sedentary group.”\nIt is important to note that the Mann-Whitney U test is a non-parametric test that is used to compare two independent samples when the data are not normally distributed.

Thus Equation 6 becomes\n\\[\n\\hat{\\mathbf{Y}} = \\mathbf{H}\\mathbf{Y}\n\\tag{7}\\]\nThe diagonal elements of the hat matrix are a measure of how far the predictor variables of each observation are from the means of the predictor variables. For example, \\(h_{ii}\\) is a measure of how far the values of the predictor variables for the \\(i^{th}\\) observation, \\(x_{i1}, x_{i2}, \\ldots, x_{ip}\\), are from the mean values of the predictor variables, \\(\\bar{x}_1, \\bar{x}_2, \\ldots, \\bar{x}_p\\). In the case of simple linear regression, the \\(i^{th}\\) diagonal, \\(h_{ii}\\), can be written as\n\\[\nh_{ii} =  \\frac{1}{n} + \\frac{(x_i - \\bar{x})^2}{\\sum_{j=1}^{n}(x_j-\\bar{x})^2}\n\\]\nWe call these diagonal elements, the leverage of each observation.\nThe diagonal elements of the hat matrix have the following properties:\n\n\\(0 \\leq h_ii \\leq 1\\)\n\\(\\sum\\limits_{i=1}^{n} h_{ii} = p+1\\), where \\(p\\) is the number of predictor variables in the model.\nThe mean hat value is \\(\\bar{h} = \\frac{\\sum\\limits_{i=1}^{n} h_{ii}}{n} = \\frac{p+1}{n}\\).\n\nUsing these properties, we consider a point to have high leverage if it has a leverage value that is more than 2 times the average. In other words, observations with leverage greater than \\(\\frac{2(p+1)}{n}\\) are considered to be high leverage points, i.e. outliers in the predictor variables. We are interested in flagging high leverage points, because they may have an influence on the regression coefficients.\nWhen there are high leverage points in the data, the regression line will tend towards those points; therefore, one property of high leverage points is that they tend to have small residuals. We will show this by rewriting the residuals from Equation 4 using Equation 7.\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\mathbf{e} &= \\mathbf{Y} - \\hat{\\mathbf{Y}} \\\\[10pt]\n& = \\mathbf{Y} - \\mathbf{H}\\mathbf{Y} \\\\[10pt]\n&= (1-\\mathbf{H})\\mathbf{Y}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\tag{8}\\]\nNote that the identity matrix and hat matrix are idempotent, i.e. \\(\\mathbf{I}\\mathbf{I} = \\mathbf{I}\\), \\(\\mathbf{H}\\mathbf{H} = \\mathbf{H}\\). Thus, \\((\\mathbf{I} - \\mathbf{H})\\) is also idempotent. These matrices are also symmetric. Using these properties and Equation 8, we have that the variance-covariance matrix of the residuals \\(\\boldsymbol{e}\\), is\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\nVar(\\mathbf{e}) &= \\mathbf{e}\\mathbf{e}^T \\\\[10pt]\n&=  (1-\\mathbf{H})Var(\\mathbf{Y})^T(1-\\mathbf{H})^T \\\\[10pt]\n&= (1-\\mathbf{H})\\hat{\\sigma}^2(1-\\mathbf{H})^T  \\\\[10pt]\n&= \\hat{\\sigma}^2(1-\\mathbf{H})(1-\\mathbf{H})  \\\\[10pt]\n&= \\hat{\\sigma}^2(1-\\mathbf{H})\n\\end{aligned}\n\\tag{9}\\]\nwhere \\(\\hat{\\sigma}^2 = \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{n}e_i^2}{n-p-1}\\) is the estimated regression variance. Thus, the variance of the \\(i^{th}\\) residual is \\(Var(e_i) = \\hat{\\sigma}^2(1-h_{ii})\\). Therefore, the higher the leverage, the smaller the variance of the residual. Because the expected value of the residuals is 0, we conclude that points with high leverage tend to have smaller residuals than points with lower leverage."

Therefore, we use the model in Equation 2 for interpretations and predictions, we will use Equation 3 to state our conclusions in terms of \\(y\\).\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n&\\exp\\{\\log(y)\\} = \\exp\\{\\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x\\} \\\\[10pt]\n\\Rightarrow &y = \\exp\\{\\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x\\} \\\\[10pt]\n\\Rightarrow &y = \\exp\\{\\beta_0\\}\\exp\\{\\beta_1 x\\}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\tag{3}\\]\nIn order to interpret the slope and intercept, we need to first understand the relationship between the mean, median and log transformations.\n\nMean, Median, and Log Transformations\nSuppose we have a dataset y that contains the following observations:\n\n\n[1] 3 5 6 7 8\n\n\nIf we log-transform the values of y then calculate the mean and median, we have\n\n\n\n\n\nmean_log_y\nmedian_log_y\n\n\n\n\n1.70503\n1.79176\n\n\n\n\n\nIf we calculate the mean and median of y, then log-transform the mean and median, we have\n\n\n\n\n\nlog_mean\nlog_median\n\n\n\n\n1.75786\n1.79176\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is a simple illustration to show\n\n\\(\\text{Mean}[{\\log(y)}] \\neq \\log[\\text{Mean}(y)]\\) - the mean and log are not commutable\n\\(\\text{Median}[\\log(y)] = \\log[\\text{Median}(y)]\\) - the median and log are commutable\n\n\n\nInterpretaton of model coefficients\nUsing Equation 2, the mean \\(\\log(y)\\) for any given value of \\(x\\) is \\(\\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x\\); however, this does not indicate that the mean of \\(y = \\exp\\{\\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x\\}\\) (see previous section). From the assumptions of linear regression, we assume that for any given value of \\(x\\), the distribution of \\(\\log(y)\\) is Normal, and therefore symmetric. Thus the median of \\(\\log(y)\\) is equal to the mean of \\(\\log(y)\\), i.e \\(\\text{Median}(\\log(y)) = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x\\).\nSince the log and the median are commutable, \\(\\text{Median}(\\log(y)) = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x \\Rightarrow \\text{Median}(y) = \\exp\\{\\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x\\}\\). Thus, when we log-transform the response variable, the interpretation of the intercept and slope are in terms of the effect on the median of \\(y\\).\nIntercept: The intercept is expected median of \\(y\\) when the predictor variable equals 0. Therefore, when \\(x=0\\),\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n&\\log(y) = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 \\times 0 = \\beta_0 \\\\[10pt]\n\\Rightarrow &y = \\exp\\{\\beta_0\\}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nInterpretation: When \\(x=0\\), the median of \\(y\\) is expected to be \\(\\exp\\{\\beta_0\\}\\).\nSlope: The slope is the expected change in the median of \\(y\\) when \\(x\\) increases by 1 unit. The change in the median of \\(y\\) is\n\\[\n\\exp\\{[\\beta_0 + \\beta_1 (x+1)] - [\\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x]\\} = \\frac{\\exp\\{\\beta_0 + \\beta_1 (x+1)\\}}{\\exp\\{\\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x\\}} = \\frac{\\exp\\{\\beta_0\\}\\exp\\{\\beta_1 x\\}\\exp\\{\\beta_1\\}}{\\exp\\{\\beta_0\\}\\exp\\{\\beta_1 x\\}} = \\exp\\{\\beta_1\\}\n\\]\nThus, the median of \\(y\\) for \\(x+1\\) is \\(\\exp\\{\\beta_1\\}\\) times the median of \\(y\\) for \\(x\\).\nInterpretation: When \\(x\\) increases by one unit, the median of \\(y\\) is expected to multiply by a factor of \\(\\exp\\{\\beta_1\\}\\)."

    "text": "Tablesz-tablecorrelation\n\n\nasasas\n\n\nThe table shows the probabilities associated with various z-scores. Each row represents a different z-score, while the columns show the z-score value and the probability (rounded to two decimal places) of getting a z-score less than or equal to that value.\nFor example, if we look at the row where z is equal to 1.96, we see that the probability of getting a z-score less than or equal to 1.96 is 0.025 (1 - 0.9750). This means that if we have a normally distributed variable, and we want to find the probability of getting a z-score less than or equal to 1.96, we can look up that value in the table and find the corresponding probability. In this case, the probability is 0.9750, then subtract from 1. The result is the probability value.\nConversely, if we have a probability and we want to find the z-score associated with it, we can use the table by looking for the probability in the second column and then reading the corresponding z-score from the first column. For example, if we have a probability of 0.9985, we can look for that value in the second column and find the corresponding z-score of 2.81 in the first column. Overall, this table can be a useful tool for working with the standard normal distribution, particularly when calculating probabilities or finding critical values for hypothesis tests.\n\n\n       z

    "section": "Maximum Likelihood Estimation of \\(\\boldsymbol{\\beta}\\) and \\(\\sigma\\)",
    "text": "Maximum Likelihood Estimation of \\(\\boldsymbol{\\beta}\\) and \\(\\sigma\\)\nTo understand the formulas for AIC and BIC, we will first briefly explain the likelihood function and maximum likelihood estimates for regression.\nLet \\(\\mathbf{Y}\\) be \\(n \\times 1\\) matrix of responses, \\(\\mathbf{X}\\), the \\(n \\times (p+1)\\) matrix of predictors, and \\(\\boldsymbol{\\beta}\\), \\((p+1) \\times 1\\) matrix of coefficients. If the multiple linear regression model is correct then,\n\\[\n\\mathbf{Y} \\sim N(\\mathbf{X}\\boldsymbol{\\beta}, \\sigma^2)\n\\tag{1}\\]\nWhen we do linear regression, our goal is to estimate the unknown parameters \\(\\boldsymbol{\\beta}\\) and \\(\\sigma^2\\) from Equation 1. In Matrix Notation for Multiple Linear Regression, we showed a way to estimate these parameters using matrix alegbra. Another approach for estimating \\(\\boldsymbol{\\beta}\\) and \\(\\sigma^2\\) is using maximum likelihood estimation.\nA likelihood function is used to summarise the evidence from the data in support of each possible value of a model parameter. Using Equation 1, we will write the likelihood function for linear regression as\n\\[\nL(\\mathbf{X}, \\mathbf{Y}|\\boldsymbol{\\beta}, \\sigma^2) = \\prod\\limits_{i=1}^n (2\\pi \\sigma^2)^{-\\frac{1}{2}} \\exp\\bigg\\{-\\frac{1}{2\\sigma^2}\\sum\\limits_{i=1}^n(Y_i - \\mathbf{X}_i \\boldsymbol{\\beta})^T(Y_i - \\mathbf{X}_i \\boldsymbol{\\beta})\\bigg\\}\n\\tag{2}\\]\nwhere \\(Y_i\\) is the \\(i^{th}\\) response and \\(\\mathbf{X}_i\\) is the vector of predictors for the \\(i^{th}\\) observation. One approach estimating \\(\\boldsymbol{\\beta}\\) and \\(\\sigma^2\\) is to find the values of those parameters that maximize the likelihood in Equation 2, i.e. maximum likelhood estimation. To make the calculations more manageable, instead of maximizing the likelihood function, we will instead maximize its logarithm, i.e. the log-likelihood function. The values of the parameters that maximize the log-likelihood function are those that maximize the likelihood function. The log-likelihood function we will maximize is\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\log L(\\mathbf{X}, \\mathbf{Y}|\\boldsymbol{\\beta}, \\sigma^2) &= \\sum\\limits_{i=1}^n -\\frac{1}{2}\\log(2\\pi\\sigma^2) -\\frac{1}{2\\sigma^2}\\sum\\limits_{i=1}^n(Y_i - \\mathbf{X}_i \\boldsymbol{\\beta})^T(Y_i - \\mathbf{X}_i \\boldsymbol{\\beta}) \\\\\n&= -\\frac{n}{2}\\log(2\\pi\\sigma^2) - \\frac{1}{2\\sigma^2}(\\mathbf{Y} - \\mathbf{X} \\boldsymbol{\\beta})^T(\\mathbf{Y} - \\mathbf{X} \\boldsymbol{\\beta})\\\\\n\\end{aligned}\n\\tag{3}\\]\n\nThe maximum likelihood estimate of \\(\\boldsymbol{\\beta}\\) and \\(\\sigma^2\\) are \\[\n\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\beta}} = (\\mathbf{X}^T\\mathbf{X})^{-1}\\mathbf{X}^T\\mathbf{Y} \\hspace{10mm} \\hat{\\sigma}^2 = \\frac{1}{n}(\\mathbf{Y} - \\mathbf{X} \\boldsymbol{\\beta})^T(\\mathbf{Y} - \\mathbf{X} \\boldsymbol{\\beta}) = \\frac{1}{n}RSS\n\\tag{4}\\]\nwhere \\(RSS\\) is the residual sum of squares. Note that the maximum likelihood estimate is not exactly equal to the estimate of \\(\\sigma^2\\) we typically use \\(\\frac{RSS}{n-p-1}\\). This is because the maximum likelihood estimate of \\(\\sigma^2\\) in Equation 4 is a biased estimator of \\(\\sigma^2\\). When \\(n\\) is much larger than the number of predictors \\(p\\), then the differences in these two estimates are trivial."

The group used a thorough and careful approach to select the final model; the approach is clearly described in the report. The model selection process took into account potential interaction effects and addressed any violations in model conditions. The model conditions and diagnostics are thoroughly and accurately assessed for their model. If violations of model conditions are still present, there was a reasonable attempt to address the violations based on the course content.\n\n\n\nResults\nThis is where you will output the final model with any relevant model fit statistics.\nDescribe the key results from the model. The goal is not to interpret every single variable in the model but rather to show that you are proficient in using the model output to address the research questions, using the interpretations to support your conclusions. Focus on the variables that help you answer the research question and that provide relevant context for the reader.\n\nGrading criteria\nThe model fit is clearly assessed, and interesting findings from the model are clearly described. Interpretations of model coefficients are used to support the key findings and conclusions, rather than merely listing the interpretation of every model coefficient. If the primary modeling objective is prediction, the model’s predictive power is thoroughly assessed.\n\n\n\nDiscussion + Conclusion\nIn this section you’ll include a summary of what you have learned about your research question along with statistical arguments supporting your conclusions. In addition, discuss the limitations of your analysis and provide suggestions on ways the analysis could be improved. Any potential issues pertaining to the reliability and validity of your data and appropriateness of the statistical analysis should also be discussed here. Lastly, this section will include ideas for future work.\n\nGrading criteria\nOverall conclusions from analysis are clearly described, and the model results are put into the larger context of the subject matter and original research question. There is thoughtful consideration of potential limitations of the data and/or analysis, and ideas for future work are clearly described.\n\n\n\nOrganization + formatting\nThis is an assessment of the overall presentation and formatting of the written report.\n\nGrading criteria\nThe report neatly written and organized with clear section headers and appropriately sized figures with informative labels. Numerical results are displayed with a reasonable number of digits, and all visualizations are neatly formatted. All citations and links are properly formatted. If there is an appendix, it is reasonably organized and easy for the reader to find relevant information. All code, warnings, and messages are suppressed. The main body of the written report (not including the appendix) is no longer than 10 pages."

    "text": "Structure & Requirements\nI will adopt the 4 “Ps”1 in this course. This means that while taking this course you will be asked to prepare, participate, practice, and perform.\nYou are responsible for the material covered in class prior to attending each class. Note that the week’s readings are specified in the course schedule.\nIn addition to these readings, the instructor may assign supplemental readings throughout the semester. These supplemental readings do not appear on the schedule as these readings will be assigned at the instructor’s discretion.\nThe assignments used to enhance your learning experience in this course include:\n\nParticipation & Attendance\nClass presence and participation points are given to encourage your active class participation and discussion. You will be rewarded with a perfect score as long as you frequently come to class and actively contribute to the class discussion during lectures.\nAlthough it is not required, most students send their professor a brief e-mail to explain their absence in advance.\n\n\nPreparedness\nYou will be evaluated on your preparedness by completing the a quiz and the major takeaways assignment before each class.\n\n\nQuizzes\nBefore each class, you will complete a multiple-choice quiz on the week’s topic. You must score 100% on each quiz. If you score below 100%, you will have to retake the quiz until you score 100%. You can only move to the following quiz if you score 100% on a quiz.\n\n\nLabs\nStudents will complete four (4) labs on this course. The purpose of each lab is to assist students in applying their understanding of the statistical procedures discussed in class as well as to provide an opportunity for students to respond to the readings.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nYou are allowed to discuss the labs with other students (and with the instructor), but you must write the final answers yourself in your own words. Solutions prepared “in committee” or by, copying or paraphrasing someone else’s work is not acceptable; your hand-in assignments must represent your thoughts.\n\n\n\n\nExams\nYou will complete two (2) exams in this course. Students may use their notes and textbook for the exams, but no outside resource other than a calculator can be used.\nEach exam has between six to ten questions, with each question worth 10 points. Exams must be completed in the allotted time. The exams (and quizzes) focus on concepts and interpretation, with most of the computational activities occurring in the homework assignments.\nAlthough the quizzes and exams will not focus on previously tested material (they are not meant to be cumulative), knowledge of previously tested material may be inherently required to answer questions related to new material.\nMost of the computational activities will be via lab assignments. In addition, selected readings will be assigned throughout the semester. The content of these readings will be included in exam and quiz questions and homework assignments.\n\n\nDejavu\nOrganization is a prerequisite for effective learning. Throughout the semester, you will be asked to organize the material presented in class in a single directory in Google Drive.\nThe directory should have a Doc file (essential links), the syllabus in PDF format, and several subdirectories for each topic covered in the course. Inside each subdirectory, you must include the week’s lesson in PDF format and any assignments or activities you did. The structure of the main directory should look like this:\nKIN610\n\nEssential Links\nSyllabus in pdf\nNavarro and Foxcroft (2022) ebook\n\nWeek 1: <topic>\n\nLesson in pdf\nAny assignment and/or activity completed\n\nWeek 2 <topic> …."

I will round up from .5% and above, but anything below this will round down. In other words, 79.5 will round up to 80, while 79.4 will round down to 79 even.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nRequests for an Incomplete (I) must conform to university policies. Among other requirements, “I” is possible only for instances in which you are demonstrating passing work in the class.\n\n\n\n\nAttendance\n\nShowing up is 80 percent of life – Woody Allen, via Marshall Brickman\n\nAttendance will be taken at the beginning of every class; please, plan accordingly.\n\n\nE-mail\nPlease, do not use the built-in email (Inbox) in Canvas. Instead, use your CSUN Gmail to communicate with me.\nIf your message concerns a non-private matter (e.g., assignments, content, deadlines, etc.), then please post your question to our mailing list, which can be answered by any student taking the course. The mailing list address is provided in Canvas.\n\n\nOffice Hours\n\nIn-person\nThursdays from 2-4 pm at RE 289.\n\n\nOnline via Zoom\nBy appointment only: www.calendly.com/drfurtado\n\n\n\nLate Assignments\nIt is important to note that late assignments are assessed a 10% deduction for each day it is late, not to exceed four days. After the fourth day of the deadline, no assignments will be accepted. Therefore, it is important to plan ahead and submit all assignments on time to receive full credit for your work. The instructor reserves the right to make exceptions to this policy on a case-by-case basis.\n\n\nExtra Credit\nThere is no individual extra credit granted. Therefore, do not plan to make-up poor grades at the end of the semester by asking to do extra credit work. I might provide extra credit opportunities, but these will be offered to the entire class, not to individuals.\n\n\nDisabilities\nFederal law mandates the provision of services at the university-level to qualified students with disabilities.\nThis instructor, in conjunction with California State University Northridge, is committed to upholding and maintaining all aspects of the federal Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA) and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973.\nIf you are a student with a disability and wish to request accommodations, please contact the office of Students with Disabilities Resources located in 110 Student Services Building, or call (818) 677-2684 for an appointment. Any information regarding your disability will remain confidential. Because many accommodations require early planning, requests for accommodations should be made as early as possible. Any requests for accommodations will be reviewed in a timely manner to determine their appropriateness to this setting.\n\n\nAcademic Dishonesty\nTL;DR: Don’t cheat!\nPlease, stop and read the information below; this is important!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nEach student is expected to be familiar with, and abide by, the conditions of student conduct, as presented in the CSUN Catalog, with emphasis on sections entitled, Student Conduct Code, Academic Dishonesty, Faculty Policy on Academic Dishonesty, and Penalties. Any student engaging in academic dishonesty (e.g., cheating, fabrication, facilitating academic dishonesty, plagiarism) is subject to discipline, which may include a failing grade in the course, and may also be subject to more severe discipline by the University. Students are encouraged to visit the link below and become familiar with the Standards for Student Conduct.\nhttp://www.csun.edu/a&r/soc/studentconduct.html\n\n\n\nAbout Plagiarism\nPlagiarism means using words, ideas, or arguments from another person or source without citation3. Cite all sources consulted to any extent (including material from the internet), whether or not assigned and whether or not quoted directly. For quotations, four or more words used in sequence must be set off in quotation marks, with the source identified.\nPlagiarism is a serious violation of the CSUN Student Conduct Code.. Any form of cheating will immediately earn you a failing grade for the entire course. By remaining enrolled, you consent to this policy.\n\nTurnitin (see below) will detect such misconducts as it checks every submission against a database of papers, as well as against the Internet.\n\nWhat is Turnitin?\nTurnitin is an automated system that instructors can use to quickly and easily compare each student’s assignment with billions of websites, as well as an enormous database of student papers that grows with each submission. Accordingly, you will be expected to submit assignments through the Canvas Assignment Tool in electronic format. After the assignment is processed, as an instructor, I receive a report from Turnitin that states if and how another author’s work was used in the assignment."

    "text": "Structure & Requirements\nI will adopt the 4 “Ps”1 in this course. This means that while taking this course you will be asked to prepare, participate, practice, and perform.\nYou are responsible for the material covered in class prior to attending each class. Note that the week’s readings are specified in the course schedule.\nIn addition to these readings, the instructor may assign supplemental readings throughout the semester. These supplemental readings do not appear on the schedule as these readings will be assigned at the instructor’s discretion.\nThe assignments used to enhance your learning experience in this course include:\n\nParticipation & Attendance2\nClass presence and participation points are given to encourage your active class participation and discussion. You will be rewarded with a perfect score as long as you frequently come to class and actively contribute to the class discussion during lectures.\nIn addition, some in-class activities will count toward participation points. These are unannounced assignments.\n\n\nPreparedness\nYou will be evaluated on your preparedness by completing the a quiz and the major takeaways assignment before each class.\n\n\nQuizzes\nBefore each class, you will complete a multiple-choice quiz on the week’s topic. You must score 100% on each quiz. If you score below 100%, you will have to retake the quiz until you score 100%. You can only move to the following quiz if you score 100% on a quiz.\nA few notes about quizzes:\n\nYou will be allowed to take the quiz as many times as you want (as long as the quiz is still open);\nThe highest score of taken attempts will be recorded for grading purposes;\nYou will be presented with ten questions on each attempt. Questions are drawn from a database comprised of more than ten questions;\nQuizzes are timed; once started, students have 20 minutes to complete each attempt.\n\n\n\nLabs\nStudents will complete several labs in this course. The purpose of each lab is to assist students in applying their understanding of the statistical procedures discussed in class as well as to provide an opportunity for students to respond to the readings.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nYou are allowed to discuss the labs with other students (and with the instructor), but you must write the final answers yourself in your own words. Solutions prepared “in committee” or by, copying or paraphrasing someone else’s work is not acceptable; your hand-in assignments must represent your thoughts.\n\n\n\n\nMajor Takeaways\nYou will be evaluated on your preparedness by submitting an assignment before each class. This assignment is meant to be a reflection of your learning. You will be asked to submit at least ten major takeaways from the readings. The content of the assignment must come from the assigned readings for the corresponding class session.\n\n\nExams\nYou will complete two (2) exams in this course. Students may use their notes and textbook for the exams, but no outside resource other than a calculator can be used.\nEach exam has between six to ten questions, with each question worth 10 points. Exams must be completed in the allotted time. The exams (and quizzes) focus on concepts and interpretation, with most of the computational activities occurring in the homework assignments.\nAlthough the quizzes and exams will not focus on previously tested material (they are not meant to be cumulative), knowledge of previously tested material may be inherently required to answer questions related to new material.\nMost of the computational activities will be via lab assignments. In addition, selected readings will be assigned throughout the semester. The content of these readings will be included in exam and quiz questions and homework assignments.\n\n\nDéjà vu\nOrganization is a prerequisite for effective learning. Throughout the semester, you will be asked to organize the material presented in class in a single directory in Google Drive.\nThe directory should have a Doc file (essential links), the syllabus in PDF format, and several sub-directories for each topic covered in the course. Inside each sub-directory, you must include the week’s lesson in PDF format and any assignments or activities you did. The structure of the main directory should look like this:\nKIN610\n\nEssential Links\nSyllabus in pdf\nNavarro and Foxcroft (2022) ebook\n\nWeek 1: <topic>\n\nLesson in pdf\nAny assignment and/or activity completed\n\nWeek 2 <topic> …."

    "section": "Course Policy",
    "text": "Course Policy\nI will detail the policy for this course below. Basically, don’t cheat and try to learn stuff.\n\nGrading\n\n\n\nAssignment\nPercentage\n\n\n\n\nParticipation & Attendance\n5%\n\n\nWeekly Quizzes\n10%\n\n\nMajor Takeaways3\n20%\n\n\nLabs\n20%\n\n\nExam 1\n20%\n\n\nExam 2\n20%\n\n\nDéjà vu\n5%\n\n\n\n\n\nGrading Scale\nA 93.00-100.00 | A- 90.00-92.99 B+ 87.00-89.99 | B 83.00-86.99 | B- 80.00-82.99 C+ 77.00-79.99 | C 73.00-76.99 | C- 70.00-72.99 D+ 67.00-69.99 | D 63.00-66.99 | D- 60.00-62.99 F <59.99\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nIn recognition of the fact that grading, however carefully done, will always be imperfect, this class will utilize a “round up” rule for assigning final grades. I will round up from .5% and above, but anything below this will round down. In other words, 79.5 will round up to 80, while 79.4 will round down to 79 even.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nRequests for an Incomplete (I) must conform to university policies. Among other requirements, “I” is possible only for instances in which you are demonstrating passing work in the class.\n\n\n\n\nAttendance\n\nShowing up is 80 percent of life – Woody Allen, via Marshall Brickman\n\nAttendance will be taken at the beginning of every class; please, plan accordingly.\n\n\nE-mail\nPlease, do not use the built-in email (Inbox) in Canvas. Instead, use your CSUN Gmail to communicate with me.\nIf your message concerns a non-private matter (e.g., assignments, content, deadlines, etc.), then please post your question to our mailing list, which can be answered by any student taking the course. The mailing list address is provided in Canvas.\n\n\nOffice Hours\n\nIn-person\nThursdays from 2-4 pm at RE 289.\n\n\nOnline via Zoom\nBy appointment only: www.calendly.com/drfurtado\n\n\n\nLate Assignments\nIt is important to note that late assignments are assessed a 10% deduction for each day it is late, not to exceed four days. After the fourth day of the deadline, no assignments will be accepted. Therefore, it is important to plan ahead and submit all assignments on time to receive full credit for your work. The instructor reserves the right to make exceptions to this policy on a case-by-case basis.\n\n\nExtra Credit\nThere is no individual extra credit granted. Therefore, do not plan to make-up poor grades at the end of the semester by asking to do extra credit work. I might provide extra credit opportunities, but these will be offered to the entire class, not to individuals.\n\n\nDisabilities\nFederal law mandates the provision of services at the university-level to qualified students with disabilities.\nThis instructor, in conjunction with California State University Northridge, is committed to upholding and maintaining all aspects of the federal Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA) and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973.\nIf you are a student with a disability and wish to request accommodations, please contact the office of Students with Disabilities Resources located in 110 Student Services Building, or call (818) 677-2684 for an appointment. Any information regarding your disability will remain confidential. Because many accommodations require early planning, requests for accommodations should be made as early as possible. Any requests for accommodations will be reviewed in a timely manner to determine their appropriateness to this setting.\n\n\nAcademic Dishonesty\nTL;DR: Don’t cheat!\nPlease, stop and read the information below; this is important!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nEach student is expected to be familiar with, and abide by, the conditions of student conduct, as presented in the CSUN Catalog, with emphasis on sections entitled, Student Conduct Code, Academic Dishonesty, Faculty Policy on Academic Dishonesty, and Penalties. Any student engaging in academic dishonesty (e.g., cheating, fabrication, facilitating academic dishonesty, plagiarism) is subject to discipline, which may include a failing grade in the course, and may also be subject to more severe discipline by the University. Students are encouraged to visit the link below and become familiar with the Standards for Student Conduct.\nhttp://www.csun.edu/a&r/soc/studentconduct.html\n\n\n\nAbout Plagiarism\nPlagiarism means using words, ideas, or arguments from another person or source without citation4. Cite all sources consulted to any extent (including material from the internet), whether or not assigned and whether or not quoted directly. For quotations, four or more words used in sequence must be set off in quotation marks, with the source identified.\nPlagiarism is a serious violation of the CSUN Student Conduct Code.. Any form of cheating will immediately earn you a failing grade for the entire course. By remaining enrolled, you consent to this policy.\n\nTurnitin (see below) will detect such misconducts as it checks every submission against a database of papers, as well as against the Internet.\n\nWhat is Turnitin?\nTurnitin is an automated system that instructors can use to quickly and easily compare each student’s assignment with billions of websites, as well as an enormous database of student papers that grows with each submission. Accordingly, you will be expected to submit assignments through the Canvas Assignment Tool in electronic format. After the assignment is processed, as an instructor, I receive a report from Turnitin that states if and how another author’s work was used in the assignment."

My role as instructor is to introduce you new tools and techniques, but it is up to you to take them and make use of them. A lot of what you do in this course will involve writing code, and coding is a skill that is best learned by doing. Therefore, as much as possible, you will be working on a variety of tasks and activities throughout each lecture and lab. You are expected to attend all lecture and lab sessions and meaningfully contribute to in-class exercises and discussion. Additionally, some lectures will feature application exercises that will be graded. In addition to application exercises will be periodic activities help build a learning community. These will be short, fun activities that will help everyone in the class connect throughout the semester.\nYou are expected to bring a laptop to each class so that you can take part in the in-class exercises. Please make sure your laptop is fully charged before you come to class as the number of outlets in the classroom will not be sufficient to accommodate everyone. More information on loaner laptops can be found here."

    "section": "Assessment",
    "text": "Assessment\nAssessment for the course is comprised of six components: application exercises, homework assignments, labs, exams, projects, and teamwork.\n\nApplication exercises\nParts of some lectures will be dedicated to working on Application Exercises (AEs). These exercises which give you an opportunity to practice apply the statistical concepts and code introduced in the readings and lectures. These AEs are due within three days of the corresponding lecture period. Specifically, AEs from Tuesday lectures are due Friday by 11:59 pm ET, and AEs from Thursday lectures are due Sunday by 11:59 pm ET.\nBecause these AEs are for practice, they will be graded based on completion, i.e., a good-faith effort has been made in attempting all parts. Successful on-time completion of at least 80% of AEs will result in full credit for AEs in the final course grade.\n\n\nLabs\nIn labs, you will apply the concepts discussed in lecture to various data analysis scenarios, with a focus on the computation. Most lab assignments will be completed in teams, and all team members are expected to contribute equally to the completion of each assignment. You are expected to use the team’s GitHub repository on the course’s GitHub organization as the central platform for collaboration. Commits to this repository will be used as a metric of each team member’s relative contribution for each lab, and there will be periodic peer evaluation on the team collaboration. Lab assignments will be completed using Quarto, correspond to an appropriate GitHub repository, and submitted for grading in Gradescope.\nThe lowest lab grade will be dropped at the end of the semester.\n\n\nHomework\nIn homework, you will apply what you’ve learned during lecture and lab to complete data analysis tasks. You may discuss homework assignments with other students; however, homework should be completed and submitted individually. Similar to lab assignments, homework must be typed up using Quarto and GitHub and submitted as a PDF in Gradescope.\nOne homework assignment will be dedicated to a statistics experience. The statistics experience is an opportunity to engage with statistics and data science outside of the classroom through podcasts, books, seminars, data analysis competitions, and other activities. As you complete these experiences, the goal is to consider how the material you’re learning in the course connects with society more broadly.\nThe lowest homework grade will be dropped at the end of the semester.\n\n\nExams\nThere will be three, take-home, open-note exams. Through these exams you have the opportunity to demonstrate what you’ve learned in the course thus far. The exams will focus on the conceptual understanding of the content, and they may also include small analysis and computational tasks. The content of the exam will be related to the content in the prepare, practice, and perform assignments. More detail about the exams will be given during the semester.\n\n\nProject\nThe purpose of the project is to apply what you’ve learned throughout the semester to analyze an interesting, data-driven research question. The project will be completed with your lab teams, and each team will present their work in video and in writing during the final exam period. More information about the project will be provided during the semester."

Your TAs and I will help you be providing you with materials and answering questions and setting a pace, but for this to work you must do the following:\n\nComplete all the preparation work before class.\nAsk questions. As often as you can. In class, out of class. Ask me, ask the TAs, ask your friends, ask the person sitting next to you. This will help you more than anything else. If you get a question wrong on an assessment, ask us why. If you’re not sure about the homework, ask. If you hear something on the news that sounds related to what we discussed, ask. If the reading is confusing, ask.\nDo the readings.\nDo the homework and lab.The earlier you start, the better. It’s not enough to just mechanically plow through the exercises. You should ask yourself how these exercises relate to earlier material, and imagine how they might be changed (to make questions for an exam, for example.)\nDon’t procrastinate. If something is confusing to you in Week 2, Week 3 will become more confusing, Week 4 even worse, and eventually you won’t know where to begin asking questions. Don’t let the week end with unanswered questions. But if you find yourself falling behind and not knowing where to begin asking, come to office hours, and let me help you identify a good (re)starting point."

    "section": "Course policies",
    "text": "Course policies\n\nAcademic integrity\nTL;DR: Don’t cheat!\nAll students must adhere to the Duke Community Standard (DCS): Duke University is a community dedicated to scholarship, leadership, and service and to the principles of honesty, fairness, and accountability. Citizens of this community commit to reflect upon these principles in all academic and non-academic endeavors, and to protect and promote a culture of integrity.\nTo uphold the Duke Community Standard:\nStudents affirm their commitment to uphold the values of the Duke University community by signing a pledge that states:\n\nI will not lie, cheat, or steal in my academic endeavors;\nI will conduct myself honorably in all my endeavors;\nI will act if the Standard is compromised\n\nRegardless of course delivery format, it is your responsibility to understand and follow Duke policies regarding academic integrity, including doing one’s own work, following proper citation of sources, and adhering to guidance around group work projects. Ignoring these requirements is a violation of the Duke Community Standard. If you have any questions about how to follow these requirements, please contact Jeanna McCullers (jeanna.mccullers@duke.edu), Director of the Office of Student Conduct.\n\n\nCollaboration policy\nOnly work that is clearly assigned as team work should be completed collaboratively.\n\nThe homework assignments must be completed individually and you are welcomed to discuss the assignment with classmates at a high level (e.g., discuss what’s the best way for approaching a problem, what functions are useful for accomplishing a particular task, etc.). However you may not directly share answers to homework questions (including any code) with anyone other than myself and the teaching assistants.\nFor the projects, collaboration within teams is not only allowed, but expected. Communication between teams at a high level is also allowed however you may not share code or components of the project across teams.\n\n\n\nPolicy on sharing and reusing code\nI am well aware that a huge volume of code is available on the web to solve any number of problems. Unless I explicitly tell you not to use something, the course’s policy is that you may make use of any online resources (e.g. RStudio Community, StackOverflow) but you must explicitly cite where you obtained any code you directly use (or use as inspiration). Any recycled code that is discovered and is not explicitly cited will be treated as plagiarism. On individual assignments you may not directly share code with another student in this class, and on team assignments you may not directly share code with another team in this class.\n\n\nLate work policy\nThe due dates for assignments are there to help you keep up with the course material and to ensure the teaching team can provide feedback within a timely manner. We understand that things come up periodically that could make it difficult to submit an assignment by the deadline. Note that the lowest homework and lab assignment will be dropped to accommodate such circumstances.\n\nHomework and labs may be submitted up to 3 days late. There will be a 5% deduction for each 24-hour period the assignment is late.\nThere is no late work accepted for application exercises, since these are designed to help you prepare for labs and homework.\nThe late work policy for exams will be provided with the exam instructions.\nThe late work policy for the project will be provided with the project instructions.\n\n\n\nWaiver for extenuating circumstances\nIf there are circumstances that prevent you from completing a lab or homework assignment by the stated due date, you may email Dr. Çetinkaya-Rundel and our head TA Rick Presman before the deadline to waive the late penalty. In your email, you only need to request the waiver; you do not need to provide explanation. This waiver may only be used for once in the semester, so only use it for a truly extenuating circumstance.\nIf there are circumstances that are having a longer-term impact on your academic performance, please let your academic dean know, as they can be a resource. Please let Dr. Çetinkaya-Rundel know if you need help contacting your academic dean.\n\n\nRegrade request policy\nRegrade requests must be submitted on Gradescope within a week of when an assignment is returned. Regrade requests will be considered if there was an error in the grade calculation or if you feel a correct answer was mistakenly marked as incorrect. Requests to dispute the number of points deducted for an incorrect response will not be considered. Note that by submitting a regrade request, the entire question will be graded which could potentially result in losing points.\nNo grades will be changed after the final project presentations.\n\n\nAttendance policy\nResponsibility for class attendance rests with individual students. Since regular and punctual class attendance is expected, students must accept the consequences of failure to attend. More details on Trinity attendance policies are available here.\nHowever, there may be many reasons why you cannot be in class on a given day, particularly with possible extra personal and academic stress and health concerns this semester. All course lectures will be recorded and available to enrolled students after class. If you miss a lecture, make sure to watch the recording and review the material before the next class session. Lab time is dedicated to working on your lab assignments and collaborating with your teammates on your project. If you miss a lab session, make sure to communicate with your team about how you can make up your contribution. Given the technologies we use in the course, this is straightforward to do asynchronously. If you know you’re going to miss a lab session and you’re feeling well enough to do so, notify your teammates ahead of time. Overall these policies are put in place to ensure communication between team members, respect for each others’ time, and also to give you a safety net in the case of illness or other reasons that keep you away from attending class.\n\n\nAttendance policy related to COVID symptoms, exposure, or infection\nStudent health, safety, and well-being are the university’s top priorities. To help ensure your well-being and the well-being of those around you, please do not come to class if you have symptoms related to COVID-19, have had a known exposure to COVID-19, or have tested positive for COVID-19. If any of these situations apply to you, you must follow university guidance related to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and current health and safety protocols. If you are experiencing any COVID-19 symptoms, contact student health at 919-681-9355. To keep the university community as safe and healthy as possible, you will be expected to follow these guidelines. Please reach out to me and your academic dean as soon as possible if you need to quarantine or isolate so that we can discuss arrangements for your continued participation in class.\n\n\nInclement weather policy\nIn the event of inclement weather or other connectivity-related events that prohibit class attendance, I will notify you how we will make up missed course content and work. This might entail holding the class on Zoom synchronously or watching a recording of the class.\n\n\nPolicy on video recording course content\nAll lectures will be recorded and available on Panopto, so students should not need to create their own recordings of lectures. If you feel that you need record the lectures yourself, you must get permission from me ahead of time and these recordings should be used for personal study only, no for distribution. The full policy on recording of lectures falls under the Duke University Policy on Intellectual Property Rights, available at provost.duke.edu/sites/default/files/FHB_App_P.pdf. Unauthorized distribution is a cause for disciplinary action by the Judicial Board."
