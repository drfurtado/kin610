## Participate

### Data collection

While in class, you will be asked to complete a set of cognitive tests. The data collected from these tests will be used throughout the semester for various purposes. The tests will be completed in class, and your names `will not be` associated with the results. I will keep the data anonymous.

In class, I will provide more information about each test.
