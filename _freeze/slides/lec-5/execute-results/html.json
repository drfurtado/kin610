Steps\n\n-   Add up all the values in the dataset.\n-   Count the number of observations in the dataset.\n-   Divide the total sum by the number of observations.\n\n## Calculating the Mean - Example\n\nData set: 12.5, 10.8, 11.2, 13.1, 12.9, 11.7, 12.3\n\n-   Step 1: 12.5 + 10.8 + 11.2 + 13.1 + 12.9 + 11.7 + 12.3 = 84.5\n-   Step 2: 7\n-   Step 3: 84.5 / 7 = `12.07 seconds`\n\n## Calculating the Mean - Equation\n\n$$\n\\bar{x} = \\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i=1}^{n}x_i\n$$\n\nwhere, $n$ is the total number of values in the set, $x_i$ is the $i$th value in the set, and $\\sum_{i=1}^{n}$ represents the sum of all the values from $i=1$ to $i=n$.\n\n## Displaying data[^1]\n\n[^1]: Bar chart created in RStudio.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n\n# Create a data frame with 3 group means\ngroup_means <- data.frame(group = c(\"Group 1\", \"Group 2\", \"Group 3\"),\n                          mean = c(10, 15, 12))\n\n# Create a bar chart with custom colors and labels\nggplot(group_means, aes(x = group, y = mean, fill = group)) +\n  geom_col() +\n  scale_fill_manual(values = c(\"#FFA07A\", \"#87CEEB\", \"#90EE90\")) +  # custom colors\n  labs(title = \"Comparison of Group Means in Kinesiology\",\n       x = \"Groups\", y = \"Mean Values\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](lec-5_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-3-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## Median\n\n-   Definition of Median\n-   Median is not influenced by extreme values\n-   Median may not be as sensitive to small changes in the data as the mean\n-   Both case below the median is `7`\n-   data1: 1, 3, 7, 7, 8, 99\n-   data2: 1, 3, 7, 7, 8, 9\n\n## Median Calculation\n\n-   First step is arranging the data in order of magnitude\n-   Median is the middle value if the number of observations is `odd`\n-   Median is the average of two middle values if the number of observations is `even`\n-   Use of median when data contains `extreme values` or is `ordinal`\n-   Helps to understand the group's typical value or performance\n-   Example in the next slide\n\n## Mode\n\n-   Definition of Mode\n-   Mode is the value that occurs most frequently in a data set\n-   Mode is often used with categorical or nominal data\n\n## Mode Calculation\n\n-   Identify the value or category that occurs most frequently in the data set\n-   Helps researchers identify the most common value or category in a data set\n\n## Comparison table {.scrollable .smaller}\n\n| **Measure of Central Tendency** | **Definition**                                            | **Calculation**                            | **Usefulness**                                                           |\n|---------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Mean                            | The average of a set of numbers                           | Sum of values divided by number of values  | Useful for data that are normally distributed and have no extreme values |\n| Median                          | The middle value in a set of numbers                      | Order values and find the middle value     | Useful for data with extreme values or that are not normally distributed |\n| Mode                            | The value that occurs most frequently in a set of numbers | Identify the value that appears most often | Useful for categorical or nominal data                                   |\n\n# Measures of Variability\n\n## Introduction\n\n-   Understanding how much individual data points in a data set vary from one another\n-   Types: variance, standard deviation, range, and interquartile range\n-   Importance\n    -   understanding data sets\n\n    -   can help researchers understand the precision and accuracy of their results\n\n    -   to draw meaningful conclusions\n\n## Range\n\n-   Difference between the largest and smallest values in a data set\n-   Limitations of range due to sensitivity to outliers or extreme values\n-   Caution in interpreting the range especially when there are outliers\n-   The need to use range in conjunction with other measures of variability\n\n## Calculating Range\n\n-   Use of jamovi to obtain the minimum and maximum values for a data set\n-   Calculation of the range by subtracting the minimum from the maximum value\n\n## Interquartile Range\n\n-   Definition of interquartile range as a measure of variability that is less sensitive to outliers\n-   Use of quartiles to divide a data set into four equal parts\n-   Calculation of interquartile range as the difference between the upper and lower quartiles\n-   Importance of interquartile range in providing information about the range of the middle 50% of the data\n\n## Calculating Interquartile Range\n\n-   Calculation: Q3 - Q1\n-   Interpretation: the range between the first quartile and the third quartile\n-   Advantages: Resistant to outliers\n-   Disadvantages: Not sensitive to extreme values that fall outside the range of the interquartile\n\n## Variance\n\n::: columns\n::: {.column width=\"40%\"}\n$s^2 = \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{n}(x_i-\\bar{x})^2}{n-1}$\n:::\n\n::: {.column width=\"60%\"}\n-   Interpretation: A measure of how much the data deviates from the mean\n-   Advantages: Widely used and well known\n-   Disadvantages: Can be sensitive to outliers\n:::\n:::\n\n## Standard Deviation\n\n-   Calculation: $s = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{n}(x_i - \\bar{x})^2}{n-1}}$\n-   Interpretation: A measure of the amount of variation or dispersion of a set of values from the mean\n-   Advantages: Widely used and well known\n-   Disadvantages: Can be sensitive to outliers; more difficult to interpret than the range or IQR\n\n## Coefficient of Variation\n\n-   Calculation: CV = $\\frac{s}{\\bar{x}} \\times 100%$\n-   Interpretation: A measure of the relative variation or dispersion of a data set, particularly useful for comparing the variability of data sets with different units or scales\n-   Advantages: Allows for comparison of the relative variability of data sets with different scales or units\n-   Disadvantages: Not suitable for data sets with negative or zero mean values\n\n## Comparing Measures of Variability\n\n-   It is essential to consider the characteristics of the data and the research question when comparing measures of variability.\n-   Range and IQR are useful for non-normally distributed data or when identifying outliers.\n-   Variance and standard deviation are useful for normally distributed data and can provide more information about the spread of the distribution.\n-   Coefficient of variation is suitable for comparing the spread of two sets of data with different units.\n\n## Comparison table {.scrollable .smaller}\n\n| **Measure of Variability** | **Calculation**                                          | **Interpretation**                                                                  | **Advantages**             | **Disadvantages**                                                                |\n|----------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Range                      | Maximum value -

see next slide.\n:::\n:::\n\n## Descriptives Table\n\n![](images/image-1239931460.png)\n\n## Summary\n\n-   Descriptive statistics help in summarizing and describing a dataset's features.\n-   Measures of variability are used to understand how spread out the data is.\n-   The range, interquartile range, variance, standard deviation, and coefficient of variation are measures of variability that have their advantages and disadvantages.\n-   The choice of measure depends on the characteristics of the data and the research question.\n\n# Practice Exercises\n\nFind several exercises by clicking [here](practice-exercices.qmd)\n\n# References\n",
