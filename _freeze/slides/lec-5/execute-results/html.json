In this study, the researchers may have chosen to report the median income instead of the mean income because the income distribution may have been skewed.\n\nFor example, let's say the researchers surveyed 100 people and found that 90 of them had an income of \\$50,000 per year, 5 of them had an income of \\$100,000 per year, and 5 of them had an income of \\$500,000 per year. In this case, the mean income would be calculated as (90 x 50,000 + 5 x 100,000 + 5 x 500,000) / 100 = \\$83,000 per year. However, this value may not be representative of the income of the majority of the participants because it is heavily influenced by the small group of high earners.\n\nInstead, the researchers may choose to report the median income, which is the middle value of the income distribution when the values are arranged in order. In this example, the median income would be \\$50,000 per year, which is a more representative value of the income of the majority of the participants.\n\n## Median - Scenario 2 {.scrollable .smaller}\n\nBelow is an example of a `fictitious study` where the authors would have chosen the median instead of the mean to report their results.\n\nTitle: \"The relationship between physical activity and depression in adults with multiple sclerosis\"\n\nIn this study, the researchers investigated the relationship between physical activity and depression in adults with multiple sclerosis (MS). They collected data on physical activity levels and depression scores from 60 adults with MS and reported the results using the median instead of the mean.\n\nSpecifically, they reported the median number of minutes per day that participants engaged in moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) and the median score on the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D). They also used the median split technique to categorize participants into high and low MVPA groups and compared their depression scores.\n\nUsing the median instead of the mean is appropriate in this case because the physical activity and depression data were not normally distributed and were skewed towards lower levels of physical activity and higher depression scores. The use of the median allows for a more accurate representation of the typical physical activity level and depression score in this population.\n\n## Mode\n\n-   Definition of Mode\n-   Mode is the value that occurs most frequently in a data set\n-   Mode is often used with categorical or nominal data\n\n## Mode Calculation\n\n-   Identify the value or category that occurs most frequently in the data set\n-   Helps researchers identify the most common value or category in a data set\n-   Example of using mode in a study on exercise habits in older adults\n\n## Comparison table {.scrollable .smaller}\n\n| **Measure of Central Tendency** | **Definition**                                            | **Calculation**                            | **Usefulness**                                                           |\n|------------------|------------------|------------------|--------------------|\n| Mean                            | The average of a set of numbers                           | Sum of values divided by number of values  | Useful for data that are normally distributed and have no extreme values |\n| Median                          | The middle value in a set of numbers                      | Order values and find the middle value     | Useful for data with extreme values or that are not normally distributed |\n| Mode                            | The value that occurs most frequently in a set of numbers | Identify the value that appears most often | Useful for categorical or nominal data                                   |\n\n# Measures of Variability\n\n## Introduction\n\n-   Understanding how much individual data points in a data set vary from one another\n-   Types: variance, standard deviation, range, and interquartile range\n-   Importance\n    -   understanding data sets\n\n    -   can help researchers understand the precision and accuracy of their results\n\n    -   to draw meaningful conclusions\n\n## Range\n\n-   Difference between the largest and smallest values in a data set\n-   Limitations of range due to sensitivity to outliers or extreme values\n-   Caution in interpreting the range especially when there are outliers\n-   The need to use range in conjunction with other measures of variability\n\n## Calculating Range\n\n-   Use of jamovi to obtain the minimum and maximum values for a data set\n-   Calculation of the range by subtracting the minimum from the maximum value\n\n## Interquartile Range\n\n-   Definition of interquartile range as a measure of variability that is less sensitive to outliers\n-   Use of quartiles to divide a data set into four equal parts\n-   Calculation of interquartile range as the difference between the upper and lower quartiles\n-   Importance of interquartile range in providing information about the range of the middle 50% of the data\n\n## Calculating Interquartile Range\n\n-   Calculation: Q3 - Q1\n-   Interpretation: the range between the first quartile and the third quartile\n-   Advantages: Resistant to outliers\n-   Disadvantages: Not sensitive to extreme values that fall outside the range of the interquartile\n\n## Variance\n\n::: columns\n::: {.column width=\"40%\"}\n$s^2 = \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{n}(x_i-\\bar{x})^2}{n-1}$\n:::\n\n::: {.column width=\"60%\"}\n-   Interpretation: A measure of how much the data deviates from the mean\n-   Advantages: Widely used and well known\n-   Disadvantages: Can be sensitive to outliers\n:::\n:::\n\n## Standard Deviation\n\n-   Calculation: $s = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{n}(x_i - \\bar{x})^2}{n-1}}$\n-   Interpretation: A measure of the amount of variation or dispersion of a set of values from the mean\n-   Advantages: Widely used and well known\n-   Disadvantages: Can be sensitive to outliers; more difficult to interpret than the range or IQR\n\n## Coefficient of Variation\n\n-   Calculation: CV = $\\frac{s}{\\bar{x}} \\times 100%$\n-   Interpretation: A measure of the relative variation or dispersion of a data set, particularly useful for comparing the variability of data sets with different units or scales\n-   Advantages: Allows for comparison of the relative variability of data sets with different scales or units\n-   Disadvantages: Not suitable for data sets with negative or zero mean values\n\n## Comparing Measures of Variability\n\n-   It is essential to consider the characteristics of the data and the research question when comparing measures of variability.\n-   Range and IQR are useful for non-normally distributed data or when identifying outliers.\n-   Variance and standard deviation are useful for normally distributed data and can provide more information about the spread of the distribution.\n-   Coefficient of variation is suitable for comparing the spread of two sets of data with different units.\n\n## Comparison table {.scrollable .smaller}\n\n| **Measure of Variability** | **Calculation**                                          | **Interpretation**                                                                  | **Advantages**             | **Disadvantages**                                                                |\n|---------------|---------------|---------------|---------------|---------------|\n| Range                      | Maximum value - Minimum value                            | The spread of the data from the smallest to the largest value                       | Easy to understand         | Sensitive to outliers                                                            |\n| Interquartile Range        | Q3 - Q1                                                  | The range between the first quartile and the third quartile                         | Resistant to outliers      | Not sensitive to extreme values that fall outside the range of the interquartile |\n| Variance                   | $s^2 = \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{n}(x_i-\\bar{x})^2}{n-1}$        | A measure of how much the data deviates from the mean                               | Widely used and well known | Can be sensitive to outliers                                                     |\n| Standard Deviation         | $s = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{n}(x_i - \\bar{x})^2}{n-1}}$ | A measure of the amount of variation or dispersion of a set of values from the mean | Widely used and well known | Can be sensitive to outliers;
