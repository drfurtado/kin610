The results showed a significant difference in both motor skills and cognitive function between the two groups, with the basketball group performing better. The t-test was used to determine the probability of obtaining such a difference by chance alone and to determine the statistical significance of the findings.\n:::\n:::\n\n## PD Examples {.scrollable .smaller}\n\n| **Distribution** | **Description**                                                                                           | **Statistical tests**                                            |\n|------------------------|------------------------|------------------------|\n| Standard Normal  | Normal distribution with mean = 0 and standard deviation = 1                                              | Z-tests                                                          |\n| Binomial         | Discrete distribution, number of successes in n independent trials                                        | Chi-squared test, goodness of fit                                |\n| Poisson          | Discrete distribution, number of events in a fixed interval of time or space                              | Chi-squared test, goodness of fit                                |\n| Exponential      | Continuous distribution, time between successive events in a Poisson process                              | Survival analysis                                                |\n| t-distribution   | Continuous distribution, used for small sample sizes                                                      | t-tests                                                          |\n| F-distribution   | Continuous distribution, used in ANOVA to test equality of variances                                      | ANOVA                                                            |\n| Chi-Square       | Probability distribution used to test hypotheses about the relationship between two categorical variables | Chi-square goodness of fit test, chi-square test of independence |\n\n# Sampling Error in Inferential Statistics\n\n## From sample to population\n\n-   Inferential statistics uses samples from a population to make conclusions about the population.\n-   `Sampling error` is the potential for error due to inherent variability in the sample.\n\n## Techniques to Reduce Sampling Error\n\n-   Random sampling involves randomly selecting participants without bias or preference.\n-   Stratified sampling involves dividing the population into subgroups based on certain characteristics and selecting a random sample from each subgroup.\n-   Increasing the sample size can reduce random sampling error by providing a more representative sample of the population.\n\n# Levels of Confidence\n\n## Levels of Confidence in Inferential Statistics {.smaller}\n\n-   `Levels of confidence` measure the uncertainty or variability in estimates when making inferences about a population based on a sample.\n-   Levels of confidence represent the degree of certainty that the true population parameter falls within a certain range of values.\n-   For example, a 95% level of confidence means that 95% of the resulting confidence intervals would contain the true population parameter if the study were repeated many times.\n-   An example can be found [here](https://drfurtado.github.io/randomstats/posts/022523-inferential-stats/#calculation).\n\n## Application of Levels of Confidence in Kinesiology Research {visibility=\"hidden\"}\n\n-   Levels of confidence can be used to estimate the uncertainty in sample statistics and make inferences about population parameters in Kinesiology research.\n-   For example, a study examining the effect of a new exercise program on cardiovascular fitness may calculate a 95% confidence interval for the `mean difference` in fitness levels between the exercise group and the control group\n-   This confidence interval provides a range of values likely to contain the true population mean difference, with 95% confidence.\n\n## Factors Affecting the Choice of Levels of Confidence {.smaller}\n\n-   The level of confidence chosen by a researcher depends on the level of risk associated with making an incorrect inference, the sample size, and the data's variability.\n-   Higher levels of confidence, such as 99%, require larger sample sizes and lead to wider confidence intervals.\n-   Levels of confidence do not guarantee that the true population parameter falls within the confidence interval, but rather provide a measure of the likelihood that it does.\n-   Levels of confidence do not provide information about the precision of the estimate, only the degree of certainty in the range of values.\n\n## Table {.scrollable .smaller}\n\nThis table shows the corresponding values for the level of confidence (LOC), Z-value, and probability (p) in a `standard normal distribution` for the most commonly used levels of confidence in inferential statistics: 68%, 90%, 95%, and 99%. The values in the table can be used to calculate confidence intervals and perform hypothesis tests.\n\n| **Level of Confidence (LOC)** | **Z-Value** | **Probability (p)** |\n|-------------------------------|-------------|---------------------|\n| 68%                           | 1.00        | 0.32                |\n| 90%                           | 1.64        | 0.10                |\n| `95%`                         | `1.96`      | `0.05`              |\n| 99%                           | 2.58        | 0.01                |\n\n# Estimation\n\n## Point Estimation {.smaller}\n\n-   Method of statistical inference used to estimate an unknown population parameter using a single value called the point estimator.\n-   Used in Kinesiology to estimate parameters such as mean height, weight, or strength of a population based on a sample.\n-   `Sample mean` is a good estimator of the population mean because it is unbiased and has an expected value equal to it.\n-   A biased estimator would be systematically off from the true population parameter.\n-   Point estimators can vary from sample to sample, leading to sampling error.\n\n## Properties of a Good Point Estimator\n\n-   Unbiasedness: the estimator has an expected value equal to the population parameter.\n-   Efficiency: the estimator has a small variance and is more precise than other estimators.\n-   Consistency: the estimator becomes closer to the population parameter as the sample size increases.\n\n## Example of Point Estimation in Kinesiology\n\n-   Estimating maximum oxygen uptake (VO2max) of all collegiate athletes in the United States using a sample of 100 athletes.\n-   Sample mean VO2max of the athletes is calculated as `60 ml/kg/min.`\n-   Sample mean used as the point estimator of the population mean VO2max.\n-   Mean of all means will converge to the population mean VO2max as the sample size increases.\n\n## Interval Estimation\n\n-   Method of statistical inference used to estimate an unknown population parameter using an interval of values called the `confidence interval`.\n-   In Kinesiology, confidence intervals can be used to estimate various parameters, such as the difference in means between two groups or the effect size of an intervention.\n-   An example can be found [here](https://drfurtado.github.io/randomstats/posts/022523-inferential-stats/#calculation).\n\n## Significance testing using confidence intervals\n\n-   Confidence intervals can test hypotheses about the population parameter by checking whether the hypothesized value falls within the interval.\n\n-   For instance, if the null hypothesis is that there is no difference in mean jump height between male and female athletes, we can check whether the hypothesized value of zero falls within the 95% confidence interval.\n\n-   If it does not, we can reject the null hypothesis at the specified level of significance.\n\n# Hypothesis Testing\n\n## Introduction\n\n-   Method of statistical inference used to make decisions about population parameter based on sample data.\n\n-   Commonly used in Kinesiology to test efficacy of interventions, compare groups of athletes/patients, and examine relationships between variables.\n\n## Null and Alternative Hypotheses\n\n-   Null hypothesis (H0): Statement that assumes the population parameter is equal to a specific value or falls within a specific range.\n-   Alternative hypothesis (Ha): Statement that contradicts the null hypothesis and assumes that the population parameter is different from the value or range specified by the null hypothesis.\n\n## Example:\n\n-   Testing whether `new training program` increases `mean strength` of athletes.\n-   Null hypothesis: Mean strength of athletes who follow program is equal to that of athletes who do not - hypothesis being tested\n-   Alternative hypothesis: Mean strength of athletes who follow program is greater than that of athletes who do not.\n\n## Test Statistics and p-values\n\n-   Test statistics: Measure the distance between sample statistic and hypothesized population parameter under null hypothesis.\n    -   t-test: Most commonly used test statistic, compares means of two groups.\n-   p-value: Probability of observing a `test statistic` as extreme or more extreme than the one obtained from the sample data, assuming the null hypothesis is true.\n\n## Example:\n\n-   Testing effect of new `exercise program` on `reducing knee pain` in patients with osteoarthritis.\n-   t-value of 2.5 and p-value of 0.01.\n-   p-value less than 0.05, reject null hypothesis and conclude that exercise program effectively reduces knee pain.\n\n## Type I and Type II Errors {.smaller}\n\n-   Hypothesis testing involves making two types of errors: type I and type II.\n-   Type I error: Null hypothesis is rejected even though it is true. False positive.\n-   Type II error: Null hypothesis is not rejected even though it is false. False negative.\n-   Type I errors can be particularly concerning in Kinesiology when testing efficacy of a new treatment or intervention.\n-   Type II errors can lead to missed opportunity to identify effective treatment or intervention.\n\n## Causes of error {.smaller}\n\n::: columns\n::: {.column width=\"50%\"}\n**Type I Errors**\n\n1.

Lack of sufficient power (N too small)\n3.  α value too conservative (α = .01)\n4.

A Type I error occurs when the null hypothesis is actually true, but the test incorrectly rejects it. A Type II error occurs when the null hypothesis is actually false, but the test incorrectly fails to reject it.\n\n|                                | **Null Hypothesis is True**      | **Null Hypothesis is False**     |\n|-----------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|\n| Reject Null Hypothesis         | Type I Error (False Positive)    | Correct Decision (True Positive) |\n| Fail to Reject Null Hypothesis | Correct Decision (True Negative) | Type II Error (False Negative)   |\n\n## **Effect Size and Power Analysis** {.smaller}\n\n-   Effect size measures strength of relationship between two variables or magnitude of difference between two groups.\n-   Used in hypothesis testing to supplement p-value and provide more meaningful interpretation of results.\n-   In Kinesiology, effect size can be used to determine practical significance of study's findings.\n-   Power analysis is statistical technique used to determine sample size needed to detect certain effect size with certain level of statistical power.\n-   Statistical power is probability of correctly rejecting null hypothesis when it is false.\n-   In Kinesiology, power analysis can be used to plan sample size for a study to ensure adequate statistical power and reduce risk of type II errors.\n\n## **One-Tailed and Two-Tailed Statistical Tests**\n\nResearchers choose between one-tailed or two-tailed tests based on the research question and hypotheses.\n\n-   A one-tailed test is used when the research question involves a specific directional prediction about the relationship between the variables.\n-   A two-tailed test is used when the research question involves a non-specific directional prediction about the relationship between the variables.\n\n## **One-Tailed Test**\n\n-   The critical region for rejecting the null hypothesis is located in only one tail of the distribution, either the upper or the lower tail, depending on the direction of the prediction.\n-   One-tailed tests are used when the research question involves a specific directional prediction.\n-   A one-tailed test has more power to detect a significant effect in a specific direction, but it also has a higher risk of a Type I error if the direction of the effect is incorrect.\n\n## Example\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Distribution of α rejection area for a One-tailed test.](lec-6_files/figure-revealjs/fig-1tailed-1.png){#fig-1tailed width=960}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## **Two-Tailed Test**\n\n-   The critical region for rejecting the null hypothesis is located in both tails of the distribution, representing extreme values in either direction.\n\n-   Two-tailed tests are used when the research question involves a non-specific directional prediction.\n\n-   A two-tailed test has less power to detect a significant effect but is more conservative and less likely to make a Type I error.\n\n## Example\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Distribution of α rejection area for a two-tailed test](lec-6_files/figure-revealjs/fig-2tailed-1.png){#fig-2tailed width=960}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## **Choosing between one-tailed and two-tailed tests** {.smaller}\n\n-   The choice between a one-tailed and two-tailed test depends on the research question and the hypothesis being tested.\n-   When the research question is directional, or the hypothesis specifies the direction of the effect, a one-tailed test is appropriate.\n-   When the research question is non-directional, or the hypothesis does not specify the direction of the effect, a two-tailed test is appropriate.\n-   It is important to choose the appropriate test to ensure the validity and accuracy of the results.\n\n## References\n",
