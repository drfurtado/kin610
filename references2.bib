  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Several studies have investigated the effects of dietary carbohydrate intake on body composition. However, the results are controversial and few studies have been conducted on an Asian population. The aim of this study was to investigate whether dietary carbohydrate intake is associated with body composition in Korean adults. METHODS: The present study used data from the Korean National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, a cross-sectional survey of Korean civilians, conducted from 2008 to 2011. The study analyzed 9594 participants. Carbohydrate intake was defined as the proportion of energy consumed from carbohydrate. Waist circumference, body mass index, and lean and fat mass using a whole-body dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry scanner were measured as body composition parameters. RESULTS: After adjusting for age, household income, smoking, alcohol consumption, physical activity, history of diabetes, hypertension, dyslipidemia, and intake of energy and fiber per day, the proportion of carbohydrate intake was positively correlated with total limb lean mass in men (β\,=\,0.141, P\,=\,0.046), and in women, the proportion of carbohydrate intake was positively associated with appendicular skeletal muscle mass index (β\,=\,0804, P\,=\,0.003) but negatively associated with trunk fat percentage (β\,=\,-0.075, P\,=\,0.026). Total limb lean mass and appendicular skeletal muscle mass index in women showed an increasing trend as the proportion of carbohydrate intake increased. CONCLUSIONS: No positive association was found between the proportion of carbohydrate intake and any measure of obesity or body fat mass in either men or women. Further studies are needed to evaluate the effects of quantity and quality of carbohydrate intake on body composition.},

This study aimed examine the relationships of handgrip strength, free-fat mass, and fat mass with bone mineral density in adolescents. 118 adolescents (60 girls), aged 10 to 14 years, participated in the study. Information on sex, age, handgrip strength, free-fat mass, fat mass and bone mineral density were collected. Multiple linear regression analyses were conducted to examine possible relationships between bone mineral density and handgrip strength, free-fat mass and fat mass. There was a relation between handgrip strength and free-fat mass with bone mineral density in both sexes. Fat mass was correlated with bone mineral density only in girls (r= 0.314, p{$<$} 0.014). The final models, adjusted for sexual maturation, included free-fat mass (girls - β= 0.419, p{$<$} 0.001; boys - β= 0.455; p{$<$} 0.001) and handgrip strength (girls - β= 0.358, p{$<$} 0.05; boys - β= 0.325; p{$<$} 0.05) and these variables together explained 51.8\% and 62.9\% of the variation of bone mineral density, in girls and boys, respectively. Handgrip strength and free-fat mass were positively associated with bone mineral density. A sex-specific difference indicated that higher levels of free-fat mass are of paramount importance for both sexes.},
