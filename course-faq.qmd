1.  Do I have to use jamovi for the statistical analyses that would be demonstrated in this course? How about SPSS?

> This course will involve statistical analyses done with jamovi [@thejamoviproject2022] , a free, open source statistical package based on R [@rcoreteam2017]. To supplement the course, I will provide links to several resources that cover SPSS [@spssinc.2008], including written and video tutorials. If you learn jamovi, you will be able to transfer your skills to other statistical programs. Jamovi also has a lot of resources available such as guides, manuals, and tutorials.
