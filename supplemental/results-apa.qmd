## One-sample t test

When reporting the results of a one-sample t-test in APA style, you should include the following information:

1.  The test statistic and the associated degrees of freedom (df). For example: "t(df) = 2.45, p = .03."

2.  The p-value of the test. This should be rounded to two decimal places and reported as a probability (e.g., "p = .03" rather than "p \< .05").

3.  The sample size (n). This should be reported as a whole number (e.g., "n = 20").

4.  The mean and standard deviation of the sample. For example: "M = 5.6, SD = 1.2."

5.  The direction of the effect. For example, "The mean score was significantly higher than the hypothesized mean (M = 4.0, t(df) = 2.45, p = .03)."

6.  Any relevant effect size measures. For example, you might report the Cohen's d effect size as "d = 0.87."

It is also good practice to include a brief description of the research question or hypothesis being tested, as well as a description of the sample and any relevant study variables.

For example: "In this study, we tested the hypothesis that the mean score on a memory task would be significantly higher than 4.0. A sample of 20 participants completed the task, with a mean score of 5.6 (SD = 1.2). The one-sample t-test revealed a significant difference, t(df) = 2.45, p = .03, d = 0.87, indicating that the mean score was significantly higher than the hypothesized mean."

### Examples

The results of the one-sample t test indicated that the mean (M = X, SD = Y) was significantly different from the hypothesized value (t(df) = t-value, p \< .05).

In a one-sample t test, the mean of the sample was significantly different from the hypothesized mean (t(df) = t-value, p \< .05). Specifically, the mean of the sample was X (SD = standard deviation) while the hypothesized mean was Y.

The results of the one-sample t test indicated that the mean of the sample (M = X, SD = Y) was significantly different from the hypothesized mean (Î¼ = t) t(df) = t-value, p \< .05.

## Independent-Samples t test

To report the results of an independent samples t-test in APA style, you should include the following information:

1.  The type of test that was conducted (e.g., "An independent samples t-test was conducted to compare the mean scores of two groups on a measure of stress.")

2.  The sample size for each group (e.g., "The sample consisted of 20 participants in Group A and 25 participants in Group B.")

3.  The mean and standard deviation for each group (e.g., "The mean score for Group A was M = 3.5, SD = 1.2, and the mean score for Group B was M = 2.8, SD = 0.9.")

4.  The t-value and p-value obtained from the test (e.g., "The t-value was t(43) = 2.3, p = .03, indicating that there was a significant difference between the mean scores of the two groups, with Group A scoring higher than Group B.")

5.  The effect size (e.g., "The effect size for the difference between the two groups was d = .7, indicating a moderate effect.")

It is also a good idea to provide a brief interpretation of the results, explaining what they mean in the context of your research question or hypothesis.

Here is an example of how you might report the results of an independent samples t-test in APA style:

### Examples

"An independent samples t-test was conducted to compare the mean scores of two groups on a measure of stress. The sample consisted of 20 participants in Group A and 25 participants in Group B. The mean score for Group A was M = 3.5, SD = 1.2, and the mean score for Group B was M = 2.8, SD = 0.9. The t-value was t(43) = 2.3, p = .03, indicating that there was a significant difference between the mean scores of the two groups, with Group A scoring higher than Group B. The effect size for the difference between the two groups was d = .7, indicating a moderate effect. These results suggest that participants in Group A experienced significantly higher levels of stress than those in Group B."

"The purpose of this study was to examine the effect of a new teaching method on student achievement. A sample of 50 students was randomly assigned to either the experimental group, which received the new teaching method, or the control group, which received the traditional teaching method. Student achievement was measured using a standardized test. The results of the independent samples t-test showed that there was a statistically significant difference between the experimental and control groups, t(48) = 2.57, p = .01. The experimental group had a higher mean score on the achievement test than the control group. These findings suggest that the new teaching method was effective in improving student achievement. However, it is important to note that the small sample size and lack of generalizability to other populations are limitations of this study."
