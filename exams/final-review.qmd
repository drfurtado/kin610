## Overview

1.  [**t-test**](https://drfurtado.github.io/randomstats/posts/04012023-ttest/): The t-test is a statistical test used to compare the means of two groups. It helps determine whether there is a significant difference between the means of the two groups.

    -   One-samples t-test: used when there is one group that needs to be compared to population value.

    -   Independent samples t-test: used when the two groups being compared are independent (e.g., comparing the mean strength of two different groups of athletes)

    -   Paired samples t-test: used when the two groups being compared are dependent or related (e.g., comparing the mean strength of the same group of athletes before and after a training program)

2.  [**One-way ANOVA**](https://drfurtado.github.io/randomstats/posts/04082023-one-way-anova/): One-way Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) is used to compare the means of three or more groups. It tests the null hypothesis that all group means are equal. If the p-value is less than the chosen significance level, the null hypothesis can be rejected, indicating that there is a significant difference between at least two of the groups.

3.  [**Repeated measures ANOVA**](https://drfurtado.github.io/randomstats/posts/04152023-r_anova/): Repeated measures ANOVA is used to analyze data when the same participants are measured multiple times under different conditions or at different time points. This test takes into account the within-subject variability and is useful in determining whether there is a significant effect of the different conditions or time points on the dependent variable.

4.  [**Between**](https://drfurtado.github.io/randomstats/posts/04222023-fanova-bb/) **and [within](https://drfurtado.github.io/randomstats/posts/04282023-fanova-ww/) subjects ANOVA**: This type of ANOVA is used when there are both between-subjects factors and within-subjects factors in an experiment. It allows you to analyze the main effects and interactions of these factors on the dependent variable.

5.  **Nonparametric tests**: Nonparametric tests are used when the assumptions of parametric tests (e.g., normality, equal variances) are not met. Examples of nonparametric tests that can be used as alternatives to the tests above include:

    -   `Mann-Whitney U test`: a nonparametric alternative to the `independent samples t-test`

    -   `Wilcoxon signed-rank test`: a nonparametric alternative to the `paired samples t-test`

    -   `Kruskal-Wallis H test`: a nonparametric alternative to the `one-way ANOVA`

    -   `Friedman test`: a nonparametric alternative to the `repeated measures ANOVA`
