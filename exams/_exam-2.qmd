# Instructions

You will be given a [data set] and various research questions that can be answered by running the appropriate statistical tests in jamovi.

For each RQ below, run the appropriate statistical test, then answer the questions associated with each RQ.

`RQ1`: Is the mean `BMI` significantly different from `25` in the sample population?

**1. Based on the results of RQ-1A, which statement is correct?**

a\) The average BMI of the sample is significantly different from the national average of 25.\
b) The average BMI of the sample is not significantly different from the national average of 25.\
c) The average BMI of the sample is significantly lower than the national average of 25.\
d) The average BMI of the sample is significantly higher than the national average of 25.

**2. Which statistical procedure (test) did you use to answer RQ-1A?**

a\) One-sample t-test\
b) Wilcoxon rank test\
c) Independent-samples t-test\
d) Paired-sample t-test

`RQ2`: Is there a significant difference in the mean `exercise duration` between `males and females`?

`RQ3`: Is there a significant difference in the mean `flexibility`score and the mean `strength` score among the participants?

### 

For each part, you will be given one or more research questions. You must then:

1.  run the appropriate data analysis using jamovi to answer each of the research questions
2.  then, using the output, answer up to 5 multiple-choice questions that will be provided on Canvas

# Part 1: Data analysis and interpretation

## Part 1A: Student's t-tests

### Research questions for Part 1A

### Steps for Part 1A

1.  Open the data file in jamovi
2.  Run the analyses that will allow you to answer each of the RQs above
    1.  ensure to check for the assumptions of normality (use Shapiro-Wilk to based your decision) and equal variances before deciding which test to use to answer each RQ
3.  Using the output from jamovi, **click here** and answer the questions for `Part 1A`
4.  Save the jamovi file (omv), not the output, as `firstname-lastname-ex2-part1`. This file will submitted in `Part 2`.

## Part 1B: One-way ANOVA

### Research questions for Part 1B

`RQ1A`: Is the mean `BMI` significantly different from `25` in the sample population?

`RQ2A`: Is there a significant difference in the mean `endurance` between `males and females`?

`RQ3A`: Is there a significant difference in the mean `flexibility`score and the mean `strength` score among the participants?

### Steps for Part 1A

1.  Open the data file in jamovi
2.  Run the analyses that will allow you to answer each of the RQs above
3.  Using the output from jamovi, **click here** and answer the questions for `Part 1A`
4.  Save the jamovi file (omv), not the output, as `firstname-lastname-ex2-part1`. This file will submitted in `Part 2`.

## Academic Integrity

## Rules & Notes

-   This is an individual assignment. Everything in your repository and on Sakai is for your eyes only.

-   You may not collaborate or communicate anything about this exam to **anyone** except the instructor and the head TA (Rick Presman). For example, you may not communicate with other students, other TAs, or post/solicit help on the internet, email or via any other method of communication.

-   The exam is open-book, open-note, so you may use any materials from class as you take the exam.

-   Only head TA and professor office hours will be held during the exam period.

-   You may **not** email the TAs questions about the exam.

-   If you have questions, direct message the professor or the head TA (Rick Presman) on Slack or post on Sakai Conversations for "Instructors in this site" only or attend my office hours (Monday, 10:30 am - 11:30 am).

## Submission

-   **Part 1 - Conceptual:** The answers to the multiple choice/short answer questions should be submitted under *Test & Quizzes* in Sakai.

-   **Part 2 - Applied:** The PDF document for the data analysis portion must be uploaded to Gradescope.

    -   You must submit a PDF to Gradescope that corresponds to the `.qmd` file on your GitHub repository in order to receive credit for this portion of the exam.

    -   You must upload a PDF, not HTML. Any non-PDF submissions will **not** be graded.

    -   Mark the pages associated with each question. If any answer for a question spans multiple pages, mark all associated pages.

    -   Make sure to associate the "Workflow & formatting" section with the first page.

    -   Failure to mark the pages in Gradescope will result in point deductions. Any pages that are not marked will **not** be graded.

    -   Make sure that your uploaded PDF document matches your `.qmd` and the PDF in your GitHub repository exactly. Points will be deducted for documents that are not reproducible.

# Data set

The data file will be provided in Canvas.

`ParticipantID`: A unique identifier for each participant in the study (nominal).\
`Age`: The age of the participant in years (ratio).\

`Height`: The height of the participant in centimeters (ratio).\
`Weight`: The weight of the participant in kilograms (ratio).\
`BMI`: The body mass index of the participant, calculated as weight (kg) / height (m)\^2 (ratio).\
`ExerciseFrequency`: The number of times the participant exercises per week (ratio).\
`ExerciseDuration`: The average duration of each exercise session in minutes (ratio).\
`ExerciseIntensity`: The self-reported intensity level of the participant's exercise sessions, coded as 1 for low, 2 for moderate, and 3 for high (ordinal).\
`FlexibilityScore`: The participant's flexibility score on a scale of 1 to 10, with 1 being the lowest and 10 being the highest (ordinal).\
`StrengthScore`: The participant's strength score on a scale of 1 to 10, with 1 being the lowest and 10 being the highest (ordinal).\
