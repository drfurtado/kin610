## Dataset {.unnumbered}

The following variables have been recorded for each individual:

1.  Age (in years)
2.  Gender (1 = Male, 2 = Female)
3.  Resting eart Rate (RHR, in beats per minute)
4.  VO2 Max (in mL/kg/min)
5.  Body Mass Index (BMI)

The dataset can be found here: [physical-fitness.csv](https://mycsunemail-my.sharepoint.com/:x:/g/personal/ovande_furtado_csun_edu/ES5kIwg0AqxDrihmhDt8n1wB1HBoLEgNjLlHV8pCSS0Wxg?e=STyWe6)

## Measures of Central Tendency (20 pts.)

Using the provided dataset, complete the following tasks:

### Question

Calculate N, mean, median, and mode **ONLY** of the participants' **BMI**. Provide the \`Descriptives Table\` below -- use the \`variables across rows\` format.

:::

### Question

Compare the mean, median, and mode **ONLY** of **BMI** for male and female participants separately. Provide the \`Descriptives Table\` below -- use the \`variables across rows\` format.

:::

### Question

Discuss which measure of central tendency best represents the center of the data for this variable and whether the choice differs between the two gender groups.

::: callout-tip
When data is not normally distributed, the median is often a better measure of central tendency than the mean. The median is the middle number in an ordered dataset. It is less sensitive to outliers and skewed data than the mean.
:::

## Measures of Variability (20 pts.)

Using the provided dataset, complete the following tasks:

### Question

Calculate the range, variance, and standard deviation of the participants' **ages**. Provide the `Descriptives Table` below -- use the `variables across rows` format.

::: callout-tip

:::

### Question

Compare the range, variance, and standard deviation of **ages** for male and female participants separately. Provide the `Descriptives Table` below -- use the `variables across rows` format.

::: callout-tip
![](images/Screenshot%202023-04-14%20at%201.46.31%20PM.png)
:::

### Question

Which of these measures (range, variance, standard deviation) would you include when reporting the data and why?

::: callout-tip
As stated in [class](https://drfurtado.github.io/kin610/slides/lec-5.html?q=variability#/comparing-measures-of-variability), when the variable is approximating normality, the most appropriate measure of variability is the variance or the standard deviation. The standard deviation has the advantage of representing the variability in the same scale as the variable, in this case, years.

## Normality and Displaying Data (20 pts.)

Using the provided dataset, complete the following tasks:

### Question

Create a histogram and a Q-Q plot of the participants' **ages**. Provide the graphs below (side-by-side).

::: callout-tip
![](images/Screenshot%202023-04-14%20at%201.50.00%20PM.png)
:::

### Question

Based on these visualizations, assess whether the distribution of **ages** appears to be normally distributed for the entire dataset and separately for male and female participants.

::: callout-tip
Based on the visualizations only, it is difficult to tell "ages" (including males and females) is normally distributed. If I had to guess, I would say it is deviating from normality. More information is needed.

When splitting by gender, the data for both males and females appear to be deviating from normality. Both histograms are skewed and the dots on the qq-plots are touching the line
:::

### Question

Perform a Shapiro-Wilk test and calculate the zkurt & zskew to further evaluate the normality of the **age** distribution for the entire dataset and for each gender group and interpret the results. Create a table containing skewness, kurtosis, and the Shapiro-Wilk test and provide it below.

::: callout-tip
![](images/Screenshot%202023-04-14%20at%201.51.59%20PM.png)

Entire data: the data is approximating normality based on the zkurt, zskew (values within +- 2.0) and the Shapiro-wilk test (p \> .05).

Male only: the is approximating normality based on the zkurt and zskew (values within +- 2.0) but deviating from normality based on the SW test (p \< .05).

Female only: same as males (values are slightly different)
:::

## Correlation (20 pts.)

Using the provided dataset, complete the following tasks:

### Question

Calculate the Pearson's correlation coefficient between the participants' **ages** and their resting heart rates (**RHR**).

::: callout-tip
![](images/Screenshot%202023-04-14%20at%201.53.59%20PM.png)
:::

### Question

Calculate the Pearson's correlation coefficient between the participants' **ages** and their **RHR** **separately** for male and female participants.

::: callout-tip
![](images/Screenshot%202023-04-14%20at%201.55.05%20PM.png)
:::

### Question

Describe the **strength** and **direction** of the relationship between these variables for the **entire** **dataset** and **each gender group** and discuss any potential factors that may contribute to the observed correlations.

::: callout-tip
Based on the criteria discussed in [class](https://drfurtado.github.io/kin610/slides/lec-7.html?q=criteria%20cor#/criteria-for-interpretation), the association for both males and females, and gender combined, is **positive and very strong**.
:::

## Simple Linear Regression (20 pts.)

Using the provided dataset, complete the following tasks:

### Question

Perform a simple linear regression analysis with the participants' **VO2 Max** as the **dependent** variable and their **BMI** as the **independent** variable.

::: callout
Diagnostics

[Linearity](https://drfurtado.github.io/kin610/slides/lec-8.html?q=cook#/checking-for-linearity): problematic

One way to check for linearity is to plot the relationship between `predicted` values and `observed` values for the outcome variable (graph 1). And to get a more detailed picture of linearity, it can be helpful to look at the relationship between predicted values and residuals (graph 2).

`Based on the information below, it is difficult to assume linearity`

-   We are looking for a somewhat straight line (see graph below)

![](images/physical-fitness.png){width="277"}

-   In practice, we're looking for a reasonably straight or flat line

![](images/line2.png){width="275"}

[Normality](https://drfurtado.github.io/kin610/slides/lec-8.html?q=cook#/checking-for-normality-residuals): Problematic

In Jamovi, you can draw a QQ-plot via the 'Assumption Checks' - 'Assumption Checks' - 'Q-Q plot of residuals' option.

Based on the info below, the data are deviating form normality. The p--value for the SW test is less than .05 and the dots on the QQ-plot. In addition, the dots on the three residuals plots below are not evenly distributed.

:::

The model:\
Direction/Strength: + very strong (.813)\
Effect size" .662 (about 66% of the variability in the predicted variable can be explained by the variability in the predictor)

Significance: The model was statistically significant (F(1, 48) = 93.8, p \< .001).

### Question

Perform **separate** simple linear regression analyses for **male** and **female** participants, with **VO2 Max** as the **dependent** variable and **BMI** as the **independent** variable.

::: callout-tip
Below I show the simple linear regression for males (first two tables) and for females (last two tables).

### Question
