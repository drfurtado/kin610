## Dataset {.unnumbered}

The following variables have been recorded for each individual:

1.  Age (in years)
2.  Gender (1 = Male, 2 = Female)
3.  Resting eart Rate (RHR, in beats per minute)
4.  VO2 Max (in mL/kg/min)
5.  Body Mass Index (BMI)

The dataset can be found here: [physical-fitness.csv](https://mycsunemail-my.sharepoint.com/:x:/g/personal/ovande_furtado_csun_edu/ES5kIwg0AqxDrihmhDt8n1wB1HBoLEgNjLlHV8pCSS0Wxg?e=STyWe6)

### Question

Discuss which measure of central tendency best represents the center of the data for this variable and whether the choice differs between the two gender groups.

::: {.callout-tip collapse="true" appearance="simple"}
## Answer

When data is not normally distributed, the median is often a better measure of central tendency than the mean. The median is the middle number in an ordered dataset. It is less sensitive to outliers and skewed data than the mean. The choice does not differ between the two gender groups as in both cases the distribution of scores for BMI are deviating from normality.
:::

## Measures of Variability (20 pts.)

Using the provided dataset, complete the following tasks:

### Question

Calculate the range, variance, and standard deviation of the participants' **ages**. Provide the `Descriptives Table` below -- use the `variables across rows` format.

### Question

Which of these measures (range, variance, standard deviation) would you include when reporting the data and why?

::: {.callout-tip collapse="true" appearance="simple"}
## Answer

As stated in [class](https://drfurtado.github.io/kin610/slides/lec-5.html?q=variability#/comparing-measures-of-variability), when the variable is approximating normality, the most appropriate measure of variability is the variance or the standard deviation. The standard deviation has the advantage of representing the variability in the same scale as the variable, in this case, years.

## Normality and Displaying Data (20 pts.)

Using the provided dataset, complete the following tasks:

### Question

Create a histogram and a Q-Q plot of the participants' **ages**. Provide the graphs below (side-by-side).

## Answer

### Question

Based on these visualizations, assess whether the distribution of **ages** appears to be normally distributed for the entire dataset and separately for male and female participants.

::: {.callout-tip collapse="true" appearance="simple"}
## Answer

Based on the visualizations only, it is difficult to tell "ages" (including males and females) is normally distributed. More information is needed.

When splitting by gender, the data for both males and females appear to be deviating from normality. Both histograms are skewed and the dots on the qq-plots are touching the line
:::

### Question

Perform a Shapiro-Wilk test and calculate the zkurt & zskew to further evaluate the normality of the **age** distribution for the entire dataset and for each gender group and interpret the results. Create a table containing skewness, kurtosis, and the Shapiro-Wilk test and provide it below.

::: {.callout-tip collapse="true" appearance="simple"}
## Answer

![](images/Screenshot%202023-04-14%20at%201.51.59%20PM.png)

Entire data: the data is approximating normality based on the zkurt, zskew (values within +- 2.0) and the Shapiro-wilk test (p \> .05).

Male only: the is approximating normality based on the zkurt and zskew (values within +- 2.0) but deviating from normality based on the SW test (p \< .05).

Female only: same as males (values are slightly different)

### Question

### Question

Describe the **strength** and **direction** of the relationship between these variables for the **entire** **dataset** and **each gender group** and discuss any potential factors that may contribute to the observed correlations.

::: {.callout-tip collapse="true" appearance="simple"}
## Answer

Based on the criteria discussed in [class](https://drfurtado.github.io/kin610/slides/lec-7.html?q=criteria%20cor#/criteria-for-interpretation), the association for both males and females, and gender combined are:

-   positive and very strong

-   significant (p \< .001)

Some factors that may contribute to the observed results are sample size, outliers, etc.

## Simple Linear Regression (20 pts.)

Using the provided dataset, complete the following tasks:

### Question - gender combined

Perform a simple linear regression analysis with the participants' **VO2 Max** as the **dependent** variable and their **BMI** as the **independent** variable.

### Question - report

Report and compare the regression coefficients (slopes), intercepts, and R-squared values for the entire dataset and each gender group. Interpret the results and discuss the implications of these findings for the effectiveness of the physical fitness program for different gender groups

::: {.callout-tip collapse="true" appearance="simple"}
## Answer

#### Combined

Slope: -1.56 bmi index (the change in y that you get when you increase x by 1 unit)\
Intercept: 81.73 (the value of y that you get when x = 0)

#### Males

Slope: -1.12 bmi index (the change in y that you get when you increase x by 1 unit)\
Intercept: 72.98 (the value of y that you get when x = 0)

#### Females

Slope: -1.67 bmi index (the change in y that you get when you increase x by 1 unit)\
Intercept: 82.67 (the value of y that you get when x = 0)

#### Interpretation

The scatterplot shows the relationship between BMI and VO2max, with each point representing a participant's BMI and VO2max values. The regression line shows the estimated linear relationship between BMI and VO2max based on the data.

The slope of the regression line represents the change in VO2max for a one-unit increase in BMI, holding all other variables constant. In this case, it indicates that for each one-unit increase in BMI, we expect VO2max to decrease by 1.56 units, on average.

The intercept of the regression line represents the expected value of VO2max when BMI is equal to zero. However, in this case, it is not meaningful to interpret the intercept in this way, since BMI cannot be equal to zero.

Overall, these results suggest that there is a negative linear relationship between BMI and VO2max, with higher BMI values associated with lower VO2max values. However, it is important to note that correlation does not imply causation, and there may be other factors that influence the relationship between BMI and VO2max. Additionally, the strength of the relationship and the accuracy of the estimated slope may be assessed using additional statistical metrics, such as R-squared and p-values.
