# Measurement

## Introduction to Measurement in Kinesiology

-   The importance of measurement in Kinesiology
-   Measurement as the process of determining the value of a characteristic or quantity

## Why Measurement is Important in Kinesiology

-   Measurement provides objective data
-   Measurement allows for comparison

## Evaluation of Interventions

-   Measurement is essential for evaluating the effectiveness of interventions
-   Measurement can help to identify patterns or trends in large amounts of data

# Statistics in Kinesiology

## Intro

-   Statistics plays a crucial role in Kinesiology
-   Allows researchers and practitioners to analyze and interpret data related to human movement, physical activity, and exercise

## Data Analysis Techniques

-   One of the most common uses of statistics in Kinesiology is for data analyses This includes:
-   Descriptive statistics: summarize and describe the main characteristics of a dataset
-   Inferential statistics: infer about a specific population based on a sample of data
-   Descriptive statistics: mean, median, standard deviation, range
-   Inferential statistics: t-tests, ANOVA, regression analysis

## Design and Analysis of Experiments and Studies

-   Statistics used to design and analyze experiments and studies in Kinesiology
-   Statistical tests: determine if there is a significant difference between groups or if an intervention has an effect
-   Examples: t-test, ANOVA

## Correlation and Causal Inference

-   Correlation: measures the association between two variables
-   Causal inference: determines if an observed association is due to a causal relationship

## Interpreting Results

-   Consider level of significance: probability that results occurred by chance (p \< 0.05)
-   Consider practical significance: meaningful results in the real world

## Visualizing Data

-   Graphical methods used to visualize data: histograms, scatter plots, box plots
-   Help identify patterns, outliers, and communicate results in an easily understandable format

# Variables and Constants in Scientific Research

## Variables

- A variable is a characteristic or factor that can change or take on different values within a study or experiment.
- Example: In a study investigating the effects of a new exercise program on muscle strength, the variable of interest would be muscle strength.

## Constants

- A constant is a characteristic or factor that remains unchanged or fixed within a study or experiment.
- Example: In a study investigating the effects of a new exercise program on muscle strength, the age of the participants could be considered a constant.

## Benefits of Controlling Constants

- Allows researchers to isolate the effects of a particular variable of interest.
- Confidence that any changes observed are due to the variable of interest and not other factors.
    
## Summary

- Variables and constants are important concepts in scientific research.
- Variables are factors that can change, while constants are factors that remain unchanged.
- Understanding and controlling constants is important to isolate the effects of the variables of interest.

# Continuous vs. Discrete Variables

## Continuous Variables

- A continuous variable is a variable that can take on any value within a specific range.
- Examples: height, weight, time
- Can be measured to an infinite number of decimal places.

## Discrete Variables

- A discrete variable is a variable that can only take on specific values.
- Examples: number of children in a household
- Discrete variables are countable, usually measured by counting.

## Difference between Continuous and Discrete Variables {.scrollable}

- The main difference between continuous and discrete variables is how data is collected and analyzed.
 - Example 1: Study investigating the relationship between weight and blood pressure, weight is a continuous variable, and blood pressure is also continuous. Pearson Correlation Coefficient would be used to investigate the relationship.
 - Example 2: Study investigating the relationship between the number of hours of sleep and the number of absenteeism in a company, hours of sleep are continuous and can have an infinite number of values, while absenteeism is discrete. Spearman Rho would be used to investigate the correlation.

## Importance of Understanding Continuous vs. Discrete Variables

- Affects the methods used to collect and analyze data.
- Researchers must use the appropriate statistical techniques for their specific type of variables to draw valid conclusions from their data.

## Summary

- Continuous and discrete variables are two types of variables used in research.
- Continuous variables can take on any value within a specific range, while discrete variables can only take on specific values.
- Understanding the difference between these two types of variables is important because it can affect the methods used to collect and analyze data.

# Levels of Numerical Data

## Intro

- Numerical data is classified into four types based on their level of measurement and the types of statistical analysis that can be used.
- Nominal, ordinal, interval, and ratio data are different types of numerical data.

## Nominal Data

- Nominal data is a non-numeric type of data that can be placed into categories but cannot be meaningfully ordered or quantified.
 - Examples: color, gender, religion
- Analysis methods: frequency distributions, chi-squared tests, contingency tables

## Ordinal Data

- Ordinal data is a type of data that can be placed into categories and can be meaningfully ordered, but the difference between the data points is not necessarily equal.
 - Examples: education level, socioeconomic status, satisfaction level
- Analysis methods: medians, quartiles, percentiles

## Interval Data

- Interval data is a type of data that has equal intervals between the data points but does not have an absolute zero point.
 - Examples: temperature measured in Celsius or Fahrenheit
- Analysis methods: central tendency and variability measures

## Ratio Data

- Ratio data is a type of data with equal intervals between the data points and an absolute zero point.
 - Examples: weight, height, time
- Analysis methods: central tendency and variability measures, correlation, and regression analysis

## Conclusion

- Understanding the differences between nominal, ordinal, interval, and ratio data is crucial because it affects the statistical methods used to analyze and interpret the data.
- Choosing the appropriate type of data and analysis is important to draw meaningful and accurate conclusions.

# Dependent and Independent Variables

## Independent Variable

- Independent variable (IV) is the variable that is manipulated or changed in an experiment.
- The IV is the factor the researcher is interested in studying.
- Example: In a study investigating the effects of a new exercise program on muscle strength, the IV would be the exercise program itself.

## Dependent Variable

- Dependent variable (DV) is the factor affected by the independent variable.
- The DV is the variable that is measured or observed in response to the manipulation of the independent variable.
 - Example: In a study investigating the effects of a new exercise program on muscle strength, the DV would be muscle strength, measured before and after the exercise program to see if there is an improvement.

## The Relationship between IV and DV

- The independent variable is manipulated or controlled by the researcher.
- The dependent variable is measured or observed.
- Understanding the relationship between these two variables allows researchers to establish a cause-and-effect relationship and draw valid conclusions from their research.

## Another Example

- A study investigating the effect of a specific training program on running performance.
- Independent variable: The training program
- Dependent variable: Running performance, measured before and after the program.

## Conclusion

- Dependent and independent variables are important concepts in scientific research.
- The researcher manipulates independent variables and dependent variables are measured or observed.
- Understanding the relationship between these two variables is crucial to establish a cause-and-effect relationship and draw valid conclusions from research.
    
# Types of Research

## Intro

- Research is a systematic and scientific inquiry into a subject or phenomenon
- It involves a process of discovering new knowledge, understanding complex issues, and making informed decisions

## Three Common Types of Research

- Historical Research
- Observational Research
- Experimental Research

## Historical Research

- Involves the collection and analysis of primary and secondary sources
- Investigates events, phenomena, or people in the past
- Relying on written documents, photographs, and other artifacts to reconstruct the past
- Understanding the origin of events, historical trends, and the development of ideas, institutions, or societies

- Observational Research

- The researcher observes but does not manipulate the phenomenon of interest
- May involve collecting both quantitative and qualitative data
- Typically does not involve manipulation of independent variables
- Can be conducted in natural settings, such as in the field or controlled laboratory settings
 - Example: studying athletesâ€™ natural movement patterns or assessing the effectiveness of rehabilitation programs

## Experimental Research

- The researcher manipulates one or more independent variables and measures their effects on one or more dependent variables
- Establishes cause-and-effect relationships between variables
- Involves using control groups and randomly assigning participants to treatment or control groups
 - Example: investigating the effects of different training protocols on physical performance or testing the effectiveness of different therapeutic interventions

## Conclusion

- Research is a systematic and scientific inquiry into a particular subject or phenomenon
- Historical research, observational research, and experimental research are three common types of research
- Each type of research has its strengths, limitations, and purposes
- The choice of which type to use will depend on the research question and the studyâ€™s goals.

# Internal and external validity

## Introduction

- Research is a systematic and scientific inquiry into a particular subject or phenomenon
- Two critical concepts in research: internal and external validity

## Internal Validity

- Definition: degree to which the results of a study can be attributed to the manipulation of the independent variable
- Importance in Kinesiology: ensuring that the results of a study can be attributed to the specific training protocol or intervention tested
 - Example: investigating the effects of a specific strength training program on muscle mass

## External Validity

- Definition: degree to which the results of a study can be generalized to other populations, settings, and periods
- Importance in Kinesiology: ensuring that the results of a study can be applied to real-world situations and other populations
 - Example: investigating the effects of a specific strength training program on muscle mass in young men

## Internal and External Validity

- Separate concepts, but related
- Researchers should strive to achieve high internal and external validity
- Trade-offs between the two may be necessary

## Conclusion

- Statistics is a critical component of kinesiology
- Understanding and applying statistical concepts and methods is crucial for informed decision-making
- Key concepts like measurement, variables, and research types must be understood and applied properly
- Understanding and applying concepts like internal and external validity is essential for drawing valid conclusions from research findings.
