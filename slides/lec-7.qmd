## Introduction to Bivariate Correlation Analysis

- Bivariate correlation analysis is a statistical technique used to examine the relationships between two continuous variables in Kinesiology research.
- Correlation analysis is a valuable tool for identifying relationships between variables that may impact human health and physical activity.
- In this chapter, we will discuss the basic concepts of bivariate correlation analysis, measures of correlation, hypothesis testing in correlation analysis, interpretation of results, and applications in Kinesiology research.

## Basic Concepts of Correlation

- Correlation analysis involves the examination of the relationship between two variables.
- The correlation coefficient measures the strength and direction of the linear relationship between the two variables.
- Correlation coefficients range from -1 to +1 and provide a numerical value that summarizes the degree to which two variables are related.

## Definition of Correlation Coefficient

- A correlation coefficient is a statistical measure used to determine the strength and direction of the linear relationship between two variables.
- It provides a numerical value that summarizes the degree to which two variables are related.
- Correlation coefficients are denoted by different symbols depending on their type.

## Types of Correlation Coefficient

- There are several types of correlation coefficients that can be used in bivariate correlation analysis, each with its strengths and limitations.
- The most commonly used correlation coefficient is Pearson's correlation coefficient ($r$), which measures the strength and direction of the linear relationship between two variables.
- Pearson's correlation coefficient ranges from -1 to +1, with a value of -1 indicating a perfect negative correlation, a value of 0 indicating no correlation, and a value of +1 indicating a perfect positive correlation.

## Properties of Correlation Coefficient

- Correlation coefficients have several properties that are important to understand when interpreting results.
- Correlation coefficients are symmetric, meaning that the order of the variables does not affect the value of the coefficient.
- Correlation coefficients are affected by outliers, and their interpretation should take into account the nature of the data.

## Graphical Representation of Correlation

- Graphical representation of correlation can provide valuable insights into the relationship between two variables.
- Scatterplots are a common method of graphical representation of correlation.
- Scatterplots can also be used to identify outliers and nonlinear relationships between variables.

## Hypothesis Testing in Correlation Analysis

- Hypothesis testing is an important aspect of correlation analysis.
It allows researchers to determine whether the observed correlation coefficient is statistically significant.
- Hypothesis testing involves calculating a test statistic and comparing it to a critical value to determine whether to accept or reject the null hypothesis.

## Interpretation of Correlation Results

- Interpretation of correlation results involves evaluating the strength and direction of the correlation coefficient.
- The strength of the correlation can be interpreted based on the absolute value of the correlation coefficient.
- In Kinesiology research, correlation analysis can be used to examine the relationships between a wide range of variables.

## Applications of Bivariate Correlation Analysis in Kinesiology Research

- Bivariate correlation analysis can be used to examine the relationships between a wide range of variables in Kinesiology research.
- By identifying these relationships, researchers can gain insight into the underlying mechanisms that may impact human health and physical activity.
- Bivariate correlation analysis can also examine the relationships between variables that may be confounding factors in other analyses.

## Pearson correlation coefficient

- Used in research studies with interval or ratio scale variables
- Measures strength and direction of linear relationship between two continuous variables
- Widely recognized and accepted, many statistical software packages include functions for calculating it
- Assumes linear and normally distributed relationship, sensitive to outliers and extreme values

## Spearman's rank correlation coefficient

- Used when data is not normally distributed or there are outliers
- Based on ranks of data, measures monotonic relationship between two variables
- Monotonic relationship means variables move in same direction but not necessarily at constant rate

## Kendall's tau correlation coefficient

- Also based on ranks of data, more robust than Spearman's rank correlation coefficient
- Used when sample size is small or there are tied ranks in the data

## Point-biserial correlation coefficient

- Used when one variable is dichotomous and the other is continuous
- Measures association between dichotomous and continuous variables

## Phi correlation coefficient

- Used when both variables are dichotomous
- Measures association between two dichotomous variables

## Gamma correlation coefficient

- Non-parametric measure of association between two variables (one nominal and one ordinal)
- Measures strength and direction of monotonic relationship
- Used in research studies with categorical data or healthcare research
- Does not assume linear relationship between variables

## Introduction

Several important properties should be considered when interpreting the results of bivariate correlation analysis

## Unitless measure of association

- Correlation coefficient is a unitless measure of association
- Not affected by changes in the units of measurement of the variables
- Useful for comparing the strength of relationships between variables measured in different units

## Standardized measure of association

- The correlation coefficient is always between -1 and +1
- Provides a standardized measure of association that can be easily interpreted
- Closer the correlation coefficient is to -1 or +1, stronger the relationship is between the variables

## Sensitive to outliers

- Outliers are extreme values that can disproportionately influence the analysis results
- Correlation coefficient is sensitive to outliers
- Outliers should be carefully examined and, if necessary, removed from the analysis to ensure that they are not unduly influencing the results

## Scale of measurement of variables

- Correlation coefficient is affected by the scale of measurement of the variables
- If one variable is measured on a larger scale than the other, the correlation coefficient may be artificially inflated
- Scale of measurement should be considered when interpreting the correlation coefficient

## Graphical representation of correlation

- Scatter plot is a graph displaying the relationship between two continuous variables as points
- The horizontal axis represents one variable, and the vertical axis represents another variable
- Scatter plot can identify the presence and strength of a linear relationship between the two variables

## Calculation of correlation coefficient from scatter plot

- Correlation coefficient can also be calculated from the scatter plot
- The closer the points are to a straight line, the stronger the relationship between the two variables
- Positive slope indicates positive correlation, negative slope indicates negative correlation

## Correlation vs. Causation

- Correlation does not imply causation.
- Two variables may be correlated, but other factors may be influencing their relationship.

## Strengths of Bivariate Correlation

- Straightforward method for examining the relationship between two variables.
- Provides a standardized measure of association that can be easily interpreted.
- Identifies potential relationships that may be important for further investigation.

## Limitations of Bivariate Correlation

- Only examines the relationship between two variables and does not consider the influence of other variables.
- Does not provide information about causation.
- Assumes a linear relationship and normality, which may not always be appropriate.

## Data Requirements for Bivariate Correlation

- Variables must be measured on a continuous scale.
- Data must be at least interval level.
- Data should be free of outliers and influential data points.

## Steps for Conducting Bivariate Correlation

1. Check for normality.
2. Check for outliers.
3. Calculate the correlation coefficient.
4. Test for statistical significance.
5. Interpret the results.

## Example

- Study on the relationship between exercise intensity and heart rate.
- Normality and outlier checks performed.
- Correlation coefficient calculated (r = 0.80).
- Statistical significance tested (p < 0.05).
- Interpretation: Strong positive relationship between exercise intensity and heart rate.

## Hypothesis Testing in Bivariate Correlation Analysis

- Bivariate correlation analysis involves hypothesis testing to determine if there is a significant correlation between the variables of interest.
- Hypothesis testing determines the probability that the correlation coefficient calculated from the sample data is statistically significant, indicating that it is unlikely to have occurred by chance.

## Null and Alternative Hypotheses

- The null hypothesis for a bivariate correlation analysis is that there is no significant correlation between the two variables.
- The alternative hypothesis is that there is a significant correlation between the two variables.
- The significance level, denoted by α, is the probability of rejecting the null hypothesis when it is true.
- Follow the example below when stating the null (𝐻0) and alternative (𝐻𝑎) hypotheses.

## Stating the Null and Alternative Hypotheses

H0: There is no linear correlation between the two variables, or the correlation coefficient is zero.

H1: There is a linear correlation between the two variables, or the correlation coefficient is not zero.

Mathematically, we can represent the null and alternative hypotheses as:

H0: 𝜌 = 0

H1: 𝜌 ≠ 0

𝜌 is the population correlation coefficient.

## Steps to Conduct Hypothesis Testing {.smaller}

- Calculate the correlation coefficient (r) using the sample data.
Determine the degrees of freedom (df) equal to the sample size minus two (two variables).
- Use a table or statistical software to determine the critical value of r for the given significance level (i.e., alpha = 0.05) and degrees of freedom.
- Compare the calculated correlation coefficient to the critical value.
- If the calculated correlation coefficient is greater than the critical value, reject the null hypothesis and conclude that there is a significant correlation between the two variables.
- If the calculated correlation coefficient is less than the critical value, fail to reject the null hypothesis and conclude that there is no significant correlation between the two variables.

## Assumptions and Interpretation {.smaller}

- The correlation of two interval (or ratio) variables assumes that the data meet the assumptions of normality and linearity.
- Normality refers to the assumption that the distribution of the variables being studied is approximately normal.
- Linearity is the assumption that the relationship between the two variables is linear.
- If these assumptions are not met, it may be necessary to use non-parametric correlation coefficients or transform the data to meet these assumptions.
- Interpret the results of hypothesis testing in the context of the research question and consider other factors that may influence the relationship between the variables.
- Controlling for confounding variables or conducting subgroup analyses to explore potential interactions may be necessary.
