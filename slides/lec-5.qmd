# Measures of Central Tendency

## The Mean

-   The mean is the most commonly used measure of central tendency in Kinesiology research.
-   It is the arithmetic average of a data set.
-   Calculated by adding up all the values and dividing by the total number of values.

## Why Mean?

-   The mean considers all the values in a data set.
-   Sensitive to small changes in the data.
-   Appropriate for continuous (normal) data

## Limitations of Mean

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
-   Not always the most appropriate measure of central tendency.
-   Extreme outliers or skewed data can influence the mean.
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
```{r}
library(stats)

# Generate a gamma distributed random variable
x <- rgamma(n = 1000, shape = 2, rate = 1)

# Create a skewed distribution by taking the square root of the gamma variable
y <- sqrt(x)

# Plot the histogram of the skewed distribution
hist(y, breaks = 20, col = "lightblue", main = "Skewed Distribution")
```
:::
:::

## Median as an alternative

-   If data are continuous but deviating from normality
-   The median is not as sensitive to extreme values as the mean.
-   Appropriate with skewed data or data with outliers.

```{r}
set.seed(123)  # for reproducibility

# Generate 1000 samples from a chi-squared distribution with 2 degrees of freedom
x <- rchisq(1000, df = 2)

# Plot the histogram of x
hist(x, breaks = 20, col = "skyblue", main = "Badly skewed distribution")

```

## Calculating the Mean - Steps

-   Add up all the values in the dataset.
-   Count the number of observations in the dataset.
-   Divide the total sum by the number of observations.

## Calculating the Mean - Example

Data set: 12.5, 10.8, 11.2, 13.1, 12.9, 11.7, 12.3

-   Step 1: 12.5 + 10.8 + 11.2 + 13.1 + 12.9 + 11.7 + 12.3 = 84.5
-   Step 2: 7
-   Step 3: 84.5 / 7 = `12.07 seconds`

## Calculating the Mean - Equation

$$
\bar{x} = \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^{n}x_i
$$

where, $n$ is the total number of values in the set, $x_i$ is the $i$th value in the set, and $\sum_{i=1}^{n}$ represents the sum of all the values from $i=1$ to $i=n$.

## Displaying data[^1]

[^1]: Bar chart created in RStudio.

```{r}
library(ggplot2)

# Create a data frame with 3 group means
group_means <- data.frame(group = c("Group 1", "Group 2", "Group 3"),
                          mean = c(10, 15, 12))

# Create a bar chart with custom colors and labels
ggplot(group_means, aes(x = group, y = mean, fill = group)) +
  geom_col() +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("#FFA07A", "#87CEEB", "#90EE90")) +  # custom colors
  labs(title = "Comparison of Group Means in Kinesiology",
       x = "Groups", y = "Mean Values")
```

## Median

-   Definition of Median
-   Median is not influenced by extreme values
-   Median may not be as sensitive to small changes in the data as the mean
-   Both case below the median is `7`
-   data1: 1, 3, 7, 7, 8, 99
-   data2: 1, 3, 7, 7, 8, 9

## Median Calculation

-   First step is arranging the data in order of magnitude
-   Median is the middle value if the number of observations is `odd`
-   Median is the average of two middle values if the number of observations is `even`
-   Use of median when data contains `extreme values` or is `ordinal`
-   Helps to understand the group's typical value or performance
-   Example in the next slide

## Mode

-   Definition of Mode
-   Mode is the value that occurs most frequently in a data set
-   Mode is often used with categorical or nominal data

## Mode Calculation

-   Identify the value or category that occurs most frequently in the data set
-   Helps researchers identify the most common value or category in a data set

# Measures of Variability

## Introduction

-   Understanding how much individual data points in a data set vary from one another
-   Types: variance, standard deviation, range, and interquartile range
-   Importance
    -   understanding data sets

    -   can help researchers understand the precision and accuracy of their results

    -   to draw meaningful conclusions

## Range

-   Difference between the largest and smallest values in a data set
-   Limitations of range due to sensitivity to outliers or extreme values
-   Caution in interpreting the range especially when there are outliers
-   The need to use range in conjunction with other measures of variability

## Calculating Range

-   Use of jamovi to obtain the minimum and maximum values for a data set
-   Calculation of the range by subtracting the minimum from the maximum value

## Interquartile Range

-   Definition of interquartile range as a measure of variability that is less sensitive to outliers
-   Use of quartiles to divide a data set into four equal parts
-   Calculation of interquartile range as the difference between the upper and lower quartiles
-   Importance of interquartile range in providing information about the range of the middle 50% of the data

## Calculating Interquartile Range

-   Calculation: Q3 - Q1
-   Interpretation: the range between the first quartile and the third quartile
-   Advantages: Resistant to outliers
-   Disadvantages: Not sensitive to extreme values that fall outside the range of the interquartile

## Variance

::: columns
::: {.column width="40%"}
$s^2 = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n}(x_i-\bar{x})^2}{n-1}$
:::

::: {.column width="60%"}
-   Interpretation: A measure of how much the data deviates from the mean
-   Advantages: Widely used and well known
-   Disadvantages: Can be sensitive to outliers
:::
:::

## Standard Deviation

-   Calculation: $s = \sqrt{\frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n}(x_i - \bar{x})^2}{n-1}}$
-   Interpretation: A measure of the amount of variation or dispersion of a set of values from the mean
-   Advantages: Widely used and well known
-   Disadvantages: Can be sensitive to outliers; more difficult to interpret than the range or IQR

## Coefficient of Variation

-   Calculation: CV = $\frac{s}{\bar{x}} \times 100%$
-   Interpretation: A measure of the relative variation or dispersion of a data set, particularly useful for comparing the variability of data sets with different units or scales
-   Advantages: Allows for comparison of the relative variability of data sets with different scales or units
-   Disadvantages: Not suitable for data sets with negative or zero mean values

## Comparing Measures of Variability

-   It is essential to consider the characteristics of the data and the research question when comparing measures of variability.
-   Range and IQR are useful for non-normally distributed data or when identifying outliers.
-   Variance and standard deviation are useful for normally distributed data and can provide more information about the spread of the distribution.
-   Coefficient of variation is suitable for comparing the spread of two sets of data with different units.

| Interquartile Range        | Q3 - Q1                                                  | The range between the first quartile and the third quartile                         | Resistant to outliers      | Not sensitive to extreme values that fall outside the range of the interquartile |

| Standard Deviation         | $s = \sqrt{\frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n}(x_i - \bar{x})^2}{n-1}}$ | A measure of the amount of variation or dispersion of a set of values from the mean | Widely used and well known | Can be sensitive to outliers; more difficult to interpret than the range or IQR  |
