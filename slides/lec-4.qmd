## Percentile and Percentile Rank {.scrollable}

Percentiles and percentile rank are related concepts, but they have slightly different meanings.

A percentile is a specific value that indicates the `percentage of values that are equal to or below a given value in a dataset`. For example, the 75th percentile is the value below which 75% of the values in a dataset fall.

Percentile rank, on the other hand, is a measure of the `relative position of a score within a distribution of scores`. It indicates the percentage of scores that are equal to or below a given score. For example, if a score has a percentile rank of 75, it means that 75% of the scores in the distribution are equal to or below that score.

In essence, `percentile rank` uses `percentiles` to determine the `relative position` of a score within a dataset. While `percentiles` focus on `specific values in a dataset`, percentile rank focuses on the relative position of a score within the distribution of scores.

# Intro to Percentiles

## Definition of Percentiles

- A measure used in statistics
- Indicates the value below which a certain percentage of observations in a group fall

## Example: 20th Percentile

- The value below which 20% of the observations may be found
- Can be used to compare the relative standing of a value within a dataset (Percentile Rank)

## Example: 90th Percentile

- If a student's test score is in the 90th percentile, it means that the student scored higher than 90% of the other students who took the test

## Determining Distribution

- Percentiles can be used to determine the distribution of values within a dataset
- If the majority of scores fall within the lower percentiles, it may indicate that the scores are generally lower
- If the majority of scores fall within the higher percentiles, it may indicate that the scores are generally higher

# Calculating Percentiles

## In a nutshell...

- Percentiles can be calculated using a variety of methods
- One common method is to first arrange the data in order from smallest to largest
- Then identify the value that corresponds to the desired percentile

## Doing it by hand {.scrollable}

- Arrange the data set in numerical order
- Determine the position of the percentile you want to calculate in the data set
 - E.g. 50th percentile is also known as the median
- Calculate the percentile by multiplying the position of the percentile by the total number of values in the data set and then dividing that number by 100
 - E.g. (5 * 10) / 100 = 0.5 for the 50th percentile of a data set with 10 values
- To find the value at the percentile you calculated, go to the position in the data set that corresponds to the percentile value

## Example 1:

- Data set: {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10}
- Find 50th percentile (median)
- Position: 50th percentile = (50 / 100) * 10 = 5
- Value: 5

## Example 2:

- Data set: {5, 7, 8, 12, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 20}
- Find 75th percentile
- Position: 75th percentile = (75 / 100) * 10 = 7.5
- Value: average of 7th and 8th values = (16 + 17) / 2 = 16.5

# Uses of Percentiles

## Understanding the distribution of data

- Percentile can be used to understand the distribution of data.
- It indicates the value below which a certain percentage of data falls.
- For example, if the 50th percentile of a dataset is 50, it means that 50% of the data falls below that value.

## Interpreting percentile values

Example 1: If the 10th percentile is 20 and the 90th percentile is 80, it means that 10% of the data falls below 20 and 90% of the data falls below 80.

- This indicates that the data is distributed relatively evenly, with a few outliers on either side.

Example 2: If the 10th percentile is 20 and the 90th percentile is 90, it means that there is a larger concentration of data towards the higher end of the scale.

## Using percentile to understand data

- Using percentile can help us understand the distribution of data and identify patterns or trends in the data.
- It can also be used to compare different datasets and see how they differ in terms of distribution.

## Comparing Data Sets

- Comparing data sets can be useful to understand how a particular value in one data set compares to values in another data set.
- Percentiles can be used for comparing data sets, especially when they have different scales or units of measurement.
 
# Percentile rank

## Definition of Percentile Rank

- Percentile rank is a measure of the relative standing of a value in a dataset
- Indicates the percentage of values in the dataset that are equal to or less than the value in question
- Example: if a value has a percentile rank of 75, it means that 75% of the values in the dataset are equal to or less than that value.

## Application of Percentile Rank

- Percentile ranks are commonly used to describe how well a person has performed on a test or assessment relative to a group of people
- Example: a person scores in the 75th percentile on a test, it means that they scored higher than 75% of the people who took the test
- Percentile ranks can also be used to compare the scores of different groups of people, such as comparing the scores of students in different schools or at different grade levels.

## Difference between Percentile Rank and Percentage

- Itâ€™s important to note that percentile rank is different from percentage
- Percentile rank describes the relative standing of a value within a dataset
- Percentage is a measure of the number of items in a set relative to the total number of items.
 
## How to Calculate Percentile Rank

- Organize the scores in ascending order.
- The lowest score should be at the bottom.
- Identify the position of the score in the ordered distribution.

## Calculate the percentile rank as a percentage. {.scrollable}

- Divide the position of the score by the total number of scores.
- Multiply the result by 100 to get the percentile rank as a percentage.

Example: Let's say we have the following distribution of scores: 60, 70, 75, 80, 85, 90, 95, 100.
The percentile rank for a score of 80 would be:

- Organize the scores in ascending order: 60, 70, 75, 80, 85, 90, 95, 100.
- Determine the position of the score in question: The score of 80 is the 4th score in the distribution.
- Calculate the percentile rank as a percentage: 4/8 * 100 = 50%. The score of 80 is at the 50th percentile.
