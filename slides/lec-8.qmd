## Linear Regression Models

-   A way of measuring the relationship between two variables

-   Similar to Pearson correlation, but more powerful

-   Can be used to predict one variable from another

## Example: Parenthood Data Set {.smaller}

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
-   Bullet points:

    -   Data set contains measures of sleep and grumpiness for Dani

    -   Hypothesis: less sleep leads to more grumpiness

    -   Scatterplot shows a strong negative correlation (r = -.90)

## Regression Line

-   A straight line that best fits the data
-   Represents the average relationship between the variables
-   Can be used to estimate grumpiness from sleep

Slide 4:

-   Title: How to Draw a Regression Line?

-   Bullet points:

    -   The line should go through the middle of the data

    -   The line should minimize the vertical distances between the data points and the line

    -   The line should have a slope and an intercept that can be calculated from the data
